<h2>Team USA Monterey Bay's Carney Places Fourth<br>at U.S. 10K Championships;<br>
Nagelkerke Joins Team</h2>
 
 
MONTEREY, Calif. - (November 6, 2004) - Team USA Monterey Bay's <b>James 
Carney</b> earned a fourth-place finish at today's Food World Senior Bowl 
Charity Run in Mobile, Ala. <b>Ryan Bak</b>, also of Team USAMB, placed 33rd in 
30:33. The event served as the USA National Road 10K Championship for USA 
Track & Field for the fifth consecutive year. Carney's finished in 29 
minutes flat, three seconds behind New Mexico's Chad Hubbard on the flat 
and fast road course.
 
Carney, 26, of Marina, Calif. earned his highest placing to date in a 
U.S. championship race. Last July, he placed sixth in the 10,000-meter 
event at the USA Track & Field Olympic Team Trials in Sacramento. Carney 
was ranked 17th in the U.S. at 10,000m during the 2004 outdoor track 
season during which he ran a 28:31.16 personal best.
 
Carney and Bak competed in a strong field in Mobile that included nine 
men who have run under 28:30 for 10K. Chad Pearson of Raleigh, NC was 
crowned the men's U.S. 10K Champion, finishing first overall in 28:33. 
Recent Stanford University standout Adam Tenforde of Palo Alto, Calif. 
was second in 28:50.
 
A recent graduate of North Carolina State, Pearson entered the race with 
a plan to make his move at 4 miles, and he did just that. He pulled away 
from a lead pack that included Carney. Running at just over 4:30 per mile 
pace, the group passed 4 miles in 18:32. Pearson then put in a strong 
surge that quickly separated him from his competitors. A purse of $25,000 
was up for grabs among Americans in the men's championship race, with 
$7,500 going to first, $5,000 for second and $3,500 for third. Prize 
money was distributed through the top 15 places. For more, see the USA 
Track & Field web site, www.usatf.org.
 
Nagelkerke Joins Team
Also, Team USA Monterey Bay announced today that <b>Scott Nagelkerke</b> has 
been selected by Head Coach Bob Sevene as an addition for its men's team. 
Nagelkerke, 23, joins Carney, Bak, and <b>Fasil Bizuneh</b> as a full-time 
resident at the team's training headquarters at California State 
University, Monterey Bay.
 
At Colorado's Western State College, Nagelkerke won two NCAA Division II 
indoor 5,000-meter titles (2003, 2004) and was a two-time (2003, 2004) 
NCAA II indoor mile runner-up. Outdoors, he was the NCAA II 5,000-meter 
champion in 2003. This year, Nagelkerke set a personal best of 13:48.91 
for 5,000 meters at the Cardinal Invitational at Stanford University on 
April 30. His additional personal records include 3:48.30 for 1500-meters 
(outdoors) and 4:04.23 for one mile (indoors). For Team USA Monterey Bay,
