Started Running: I have been struggling with the marathon 
distance for about 3 years now...trying to qualify for Boston. 
Each time I try to run over 15 miles, my legs become very heavy, 
like cement and I experience intense pain that makes me end my 
run with walking. Everything hurts from the hips down...my lower 
body screams and tenses in pain. I try to tell myself that I'll 
become stronger with each training run, but it seems to get worse 
with each attempt.
Also, I pulled my hamstring in 2004 doing speed intervals on 
the track, so I have been struggling with speed since then.
Since I started racing at the late age of 53, I feel like a snail in 
comparison to the many young runners out there who continually pass me 
in training runs and races. 

Top Races: 	 My best race would have to be this year's Heritage Oaks 
Bank 10K Masters Championship because not only did I get a 10K PR with 
my 53:00 flat time...my previous PR was 53:11 at HP's Up & Running 10K 
in 2004, but I am proud to say that I got 2nd place because of my 
perseverence to hang in there and stay with the 1st place leader...I had 
been trying to get a 10K PR for 2 years! So it felt good to achieve this 
result after such hard work.
   
Accomplishments:  I have run 13 marathons since 2001, including Pike's 
Peak in Colorado, by far the most challenging in terms of terrain and altitude.
I have also run 3 Double Dipsea hadicap races, though I struggled to finish my 
first due to hypothermia? 
 
Other Accomplishments: I have skiied down Gunbarrel at Squaw Valley and 
cross-country skiied at Yosemite.

Goals: 	 I would like to qualify for Boston Marathon(need 4:15) and would 
like to run a marathon in each of the 50 states. 
I also hope to do ultra-marathons, and would like to finish the Western States 
100 as a long-range goal.
  
Role Models: 	 Judith Webb of DSE, a 63 year-old marathoner who has 
run Boston numerous times and the many dedicated runners of the WVJS running 
club who continually strive for excellence in their running.
  
Favorite Races:	 The DSE Double Dipsea, 13.7 miles of steep terrain and 
steps(Stinson Beach-Mill Valley-Stinson Beach).
Los Gatos Jungle Run Half Marathon
San Jose Rock n Roll Half Marathon
  
Hobbies:  I am developing a web-based database software program for my 
running club, which will track running stats for club members and handicap 
runners for club-sponsored races.
