PA/USATF LDR CHAMPIONSHIP CONTRACT 

2006 SEASON 



1. 	The sponsoring organization agrees to sanction the event with the 

Pacific Association of USA Track & Field (PA/USATF). Fee schedules and 

sanction forms may be obtained from the Pacific Association office, 120 

Ponderosa Court, Folsom, CA 95630, tel. (916) 983-4715, fax (916) 983-4624, 

e-mail pausatf@aol.com.



2.	The sponsoring organization agrees to certify the course for record 

purposes prior to the competition.



3.	The sponsoring organization agrees to meet the following requirements 

for race results submission and record keeping:



a. Within 48 hours of the completion of the event:



(i) Submit complete results to the designated Pacific Association Road Grand 

Prix Scorer according to Pacific Association guidelines.



b. Within 30 days of the completion of the event:



(i) Submit complete final results to USATF's Road Running Information Center 

(USATF's road record keeping body) according to the Center's results submission 

guidelines.



(ii) Submit to the Road Running Information Center  a complete and accurate 

"Application for the Recognition of Road Race Performances."



Note: Guidelines for the submission of race results data are attached. If the 

event fails to meet requirements for race results submission and record keeping, 

it will be subject to ineligibility for future Pacific Association championships 

as determined by the LDR Committee.





4.	The sponsoring organization agrees to pay the total amount of prize money 

to the Pacific Association at least ten (10) days PRIOR to race date, to be placed 

in an escrow account for the winning athletes.



5.	The sponsoring organization agrees to provide trained officials to monitor 

the event for pacing, unfair assistance, and order of finishers at the finish line, 

as well as to ensure that all competitors complete the entire distance while adhering 

to USATF’s rules of competition.



6.  	The sponsoring organization agrees to have present during the race qualified 

medical personnel who can administer emergency care. The race day referee has the 

right to refuse to allow the race to begin until the medical personnel have been 

identified to him or her.



7.	The sponsoring organization agrees to advertise at least one full page in 

PA/USATF’s official publication, California Track and Running News. 



8. 	The sponsoring organization agrees to list on all advertising and race 

applications the time at which awards will be presented.



9.	All championships are championships for individuals, as well as for teams 

(clubs), unless it is a relay event (team only). The sponsoring organization agrees 

to allow all Pacific Association USATF clubs the opportunity to enter the competition. 

If there is a maximum limit to the number of entries, there will be at least 500 

entries reserved for PA/USATF members, and each club will be allowed enough entries 

to comprise a scoring team plus two additional entries in each PA scoring division, 

provided the runners meet the entry deadlines.



10.	The sponsoring organization agrees to provide space on the entry form for a 

USATF number. 



11.	The sponsoring organization agrees to provide space on the entry form for the 

club name and include club names on the results printout.



12.	The sponsoring organization agrees to include on the entry form the wording 

PACIFIC ASSOCIATION/USATF CHAMPIONSHIP and to indicate in which PA/USATF divisions 

the Championship is being contested. The official PA/USATF Grand Prix divisions are 

Open Women and Open Men (39 and under), Masters Men and Masters Women (40-49), Senior 

Women and Senior Men (50-59), Super Senior Men and Super Senior Women (60-69), and 

Veteran Women and Veteran Men (70+).



13.	The sponsoring organization agrees to also include the wording AWARD WINNERS 

MUST BE PACIFIC ASSOCIATION USATF MEMBERS and PRIZE MONEY IS AWARDED TO PACIFIC 

ASSOCIATION USATF MEMBERS ONLY,” for that amount of money that is guaranteed for the 

Championship.



14.	The sponsoring organization agrees to award certificates, medals, or patches 

to at least the top three individuals in the age group of 18-under and after that in 

every five-year age bracket (19–24, 25–29, 30–34, 35–39, 40–44, etc., through 90-plus), 

and to specify on the entry form these awards and these specific divisions in which 

they will be awarded. Race results will be scored in the age divisions specified here.



15.	The sponsoring organization agrees to provide at least $2,600 in prize funds 

for the championship, with $100 reserved for PA/USATF athlete development and the 

remaining $2,500 going to championship prize money. Events may earn extra Grand Prix 

point value by increasing the total money to Pacific Association athletes and teams. 

For example, a race offering $5,200 will likely be worth double points, while a race 

offering $6,500 will likely be worth 2.5 points. The PA may decide to limit the maximum 

number of points a race can receive in an effort to keep one race from dominating the 

schedule too heavily.



16.	If there is no winner in a category, the PA will return the prize money to the 

race director. For instance, if no PA member competes in the Veterans category, that 

prize money is returned to the race director. 



17.	Prize money for a race offering the minimum $2,600 prize purse will be paid out 

according to the standard Grand Prix breakdown. For races offering more than $2,600 in 

prize money, or races which are not championships in all age/gender divisions, the prize 

money breakdown will follow the Pacific Association’s standard breakdown for that amount 

of prize money. In any case, the standard breakdown is the minimum for each age/gender 

division for which the race is a Championship. In addition, the total prize money figure 

for the Championship should be specified on the entry form, for example, “$2,500 PA/USATF 

CHAMPIONSHIP PRIZE PURSE.”



18.	The sponsoring organization agrees to provide free entries to the top 15 open, 

top 10 master (40–49), top 5 senior (50–59), top 1 super senior (60–69), and top 1 veteran 

(70+) Grand Prix winners, male and female, from the previous year. All top Grand Prix 

competitors who are eligible for free entry must pre-register in order to receive the free 

entry. (Each Championship is required to provide free entries only in those divisions in 

which the Championship is being contested.)



19.	The sponsoring organization agrees to provide the Pacific Association USATF office 

complete results in a timely fashion.



20.	No Championship may be held on the same weekend as another.



21.	The sponsoring organization agrees to pay the Pacific Association a penalty of 

$500 if they default on their bid six (6) months prior to the scheduled race date, and a 

penalty of $1,000 if they default on their bid three (3) months prior to the race date.



22.	Promotional Responsibilities: The event shall (a) in its printed material and 

advertising, including its entry forms, prominently identify the event as a member of 

the Road Grand Prix (including the name of the Grand Prix title sponsors) and shall 

include the USATF logo; (b) permit USATF banner/signage, and banners/signage of its 

official Grand Prix sponsors to be displayed (as agreed upon by PA/USATF and the event); 

(c) provide a finish line presence to USATF and its Grand Prix sponsors in the form of 

a preferred location and table(s) for literature and representatives and provide the same 

in the form of an Expo booth if the event has an Expo; (d) at PA/USATF’s request include 

USATF and Grand Prix sponsor literature in all runner’s packets; (e) if the event has a 

race program, include a Grand Prix article provided by PA/USATF.



23.	Failure to execute or abide by any of the items 1–20 above may result in a forfeiture 

of the Championship.
