2. MINUTES:  Motion to accept minutes of 3-17-01; seconded and approved. 

3. TREASURERS’ REPORT:  Draft audit report given to Podkaminer for review.  
The final audit report will be available at our next meeting in September.  
Motion to accept Treasurers report of 3-17-01; seconded and passed.

4. TRACK AND FIELD:  Partnership between SSC and PA is going well; agreements 
are in place and solid.  Still confidant that the meet will not cost, but 
will possibly show a profit.  The biggest problem is finding backup generator 
power.  Volunteers are still needed for the success of our JO National’s.  
Coca-Cola has given us a sponsorship.  There is an opportunity for the Youth 
Committee to make additional funds by selling their products during the 
national meet.  Check with Mansoor for further details.  

5. WAVA 2005:  2003 Championships have been moved to Puerto Rico.  There are 
three bidders for 2005 - San Sebastian, Finland and Sacramento.  We have a 
pretty good chance of getting the bid.  SSC will make their presentation in 
Brisbane this year in July.  

6. BY-LAW CHANGES:  Articles 8 and 11 need minor changes for house keeping 
purposes.  8 should read "overview and make recommendations" and number 11 
should read as article 16Cinstead of 16D.  Article 10 should read "a current 
version must be sent."  Motion is made to accept the by-law changes; seconded 
and passed.  A new Coaches Education Committee has been recommended and 
discussed.  Motion made to table the issue of creating this new committee; 
seconded and passed.

7. GRIEVANCES:  We have no new grievances. There are three outstanding issues 
with one from LDR and two from Youth.  There is an investigation from the LDR 
Committee to determine whether or not there are grounds for disqualification 
at the Houlihan Race.  Based on the newly enacted youth rule of a "zero 
tolerance" policy, a club was not allowed to compete for two weeks of 
competition.  The other issue was not to accept registration from another 
youth club based on inappropriate actions on their part. 

8. COMMITTEE REPORTS:  
·   Executive Director - National Office has a new system for membership.  
They have sent it to ten associations to test it out and we are the only 
association to use it.  The system remains on-line at all times.  All 
associations can tap into it for information.  Starting November 1st, all 
associations will be required to use this system; each association having 
until then to perfect it on their end.   Regarding privacy, we have voted not 
to release our list to other outside agencies.  The National Office has now 
decided to put a privacy statement on the registration application.  
·   Membership - Currently we have registered approximately 4,200 athletes; 
401 on line registrations, 1,020 male adults, 559 female adults, 704 youth 
girls and 776 youth boys.  USATF generic brochures will be available for 
purchase to all committees at a cost of $80 per 1,000 brochures.  If 
committees want this item they will have to budget for them.
·   Officials - We currently have over 200 certified officials.  Rich has 
done a wonderful job handling the recertification of our PA officials.  Our 
total last year was 258 so we are definitely on track.
·   Racewalk - The racewalk committee would like to put on a racewalk clinic 
at the JO National’s; requesting approval from PA youth committee to proceed. 
 Mansoor is checking into the feasibility of conducting the seminar.  
·   Communication - Request to have minutes available on line from previous 
meetings and keep as archive file.  Motion to have most recent agenda, 
meeting notice and minutes posted on the website a minimum of seven days 
before the meeting.  Seconded and passed.
·   Open Track & Field - Due to the diligence of Dan the results have been 
updated every week with a lot of positive feedback from the athletes.  8 out 
of 10 women and 6 out 10 men have already qualified for nationals.   
·   LDR - Website for Northern California results is www.directathletics.com. 
 There are three weeks of highly publicized track and field watching before 
we get to the nationals.   

9. MISCELLANEOUS:    
·   Donations:  $1,000 from  SF State, $150 from DeLasalle High School; 
$5,000 for LDR Grand  Prix - NuBalance has expressed strong interest in 
sponsoring grand prix; another way is to require membership to California 
Track and Running news for new athletes. 
·   Kleeman appoints a committee of three to count election result votes and 
report back with the results later during the meeting.  Bob Bowman is elected 
President and Jerry Colman elected Vice President.  Motion made to destroy 
the ballots; seconded and passed.  The total votes received were forty-two 
out of potential seventy-two.  The official start date for the new officers 
is July 1st.  A reminder that all sport committees must hold their elections 
by July 31st so new committee chairs can participate in the budget process; 
that BOD Budget meeting taking place in August.
·   Kleeman makes presentation awards as outgoing president.
·   Lydum’s have resigned as track coaches at San Francisco State.
·   Joe Knapp has been named meet director for 2003 NCAA meet. 

Motion to adjourn.  Seconded.  Meeting adjourned
Our next meeting will be September 19, 2001 in  Foster City
