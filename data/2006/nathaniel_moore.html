<font size="5"><b>First time's a charm for bantam long-jumper</font></b><br><br>
<font size="3">
<b>By Vicky Boyd</b><br><br>


<p>In the first long-jump competition of his life, 10-year-old Nathaniel Moore did what most athletes could only dream--he set a Pacific Association USA Track and Field record.
<p>The bantam athlete from Mission Valley Track and Field of Union City jumped 15 feet 5 1/2 inches at the Junior Olympic Championships, June 24, in Livermore. The previous record, 15 feet 1 inch, was set in 2004 by Byron Marshall, who competed unattached. 
<p>The fete surprised Moore's mother, Trina Davis, even though she knew her son was competitive.
<p>"I was shocked, because that was his first time long-jumping," Davis says. "I didn't really know he had it in him."
<p>But Arno Brewer, Mission Valley's head coach who also works with the jumpers, says the record jump just backed his hunches.
<p>"I figured he could jump 15 feet just by what he was doing in practice, and it usually takes a while for kids to jump well," Brewer says. "I guess what surprised me is we haven't worked a lot on the approach, and that is the most important part. If we really work, he could probably jump 17 feet."
<p>Moore may make long-jumping look easy, but inside he's still nervous.
<p>"There are still butterflies--it doesn't get any easier at all," he says.
<p>At the Region 14 meet, July 8 and 9, in Livermore, Moore again broke Marshall's record by jumping 4.62 meters, equivalent to 15 feet 1.8 inches. In addition, he took first in the bantam boys 100-meter dash with 13.47 and was part of Mission Valley's bantam boys "A" 4x100-relay team that took second with 57.13.
<p>Off the field, Moore also excels. He is an honor-roll student at Ardenwood Elementary in Fremont, where he will be a fifth grader in the fall.
