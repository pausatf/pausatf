Goucher, Russell and Blood take titles at USA Cross Country
Championships presented by Gleukos

NEW YORK - Nicole Blood of Gansevoort, N.Y., Adam Goucher of Portland,
Ore. and Blake Russell of Marina, Calif., captured U.S. titles at the
2006 USA Cross Country Championships presented by Gleukos held at Van
Cortlandt Park on Saturday.

In addition to crowning national champions, the championships served as
the selection event for the U.S. team that will compete at the 2006 IAAF
World Cross Country Championships. The top six finishers in the Open and
Junior races are eligible to compete for the U.S. team on April 1-2 in
Fukuoka, Japan. The USA Championships follows the same format as the
upcoming World Championships, with six races over a two-day span.

The Junior women's 6 km began under cold, windy conditions to lead off
an exciting day of cross country racing at the legendary course in the
Bronx. Blood and last year's runner-up Erin Bedell of Plano Texas took
charge during the first circuit of the three loop course with Mckayla
Plank (Los Gatos, Calif.), Madeline McKeever (Durham N.C.), Kauren
Tarver (Wrightwood, Calif.), and Marie Lawrence (Reno, Nevada) on their
heels. 

As the race progressed into the final lap, Plank and Tarver positioned
themselves to take the win over Blood but as the trio headed into the
home-stretch, Blood had one more gear that took her to her first USA
Cross Country title in 20:45 with Plank and Tarver finishing second and
third running 20:46 and 20:47, respectively. Lawrence, Bedell and
McKeever rounded out the top-six while qualifying for the U.S. Cross
Country squad for Fukuoka.

"It was tough today. I had a really good feeling with about 800 meters
to go; then I kicked it in," said Blood, who will attend the University
of Oregon in the fall. "It's going to be a good experience going to
Japan. It's kind of sad that this is my last race in New York. I love
this course." 

The senior men's 4 km featured a strong field with any one of ten men
that might emerge as champion. After the first 2 km circuit, only four
were in contention for the win with Goucher, Ryan Hall (Woodside,
Calif.), Daniel Lincoln (Little Rock, Ark.), and Jorge Torres (Boulder,
Colo.), in front of the field by ten meters.

As the field entered the final straight away it was Goucher pressing to
the front for the title running 10:50 to finish two seconds ahead of
Daniel Lincoln. Ryan Hall, Jorge Torres, Ian Dobson and Luke Watson
rounded out the top-six to qualify for the Team USA cross country team.

"I wanted to get in good position early, as the course narrowed quickly.
I knew that within the first half mile, the contenders would show their
faces," said Goucher, the 2000 USA champion at 4 km. "I knew that this
would be a close race with Jorge (Torres), and Ryan Hall, and Daniel
Lincoln in there. Overall I think that this is going to be the strongest
U.S. 4 km team going to worlds."

In the final race of the day, two-time defending champion Colleen De
Reuck of Boulder, Colo., Russell and Katie McGregor (Saint Louis Park,
Minn.), took charge early, opening a gap on the field by the end of the
first loop. Shortly after the start of the second circuit, Russell began
to push to the front and by the beginning of the third lap McGregor had
fallen 10 meters off the pace.

As Russell and De Reuck battled for the win on the final loop, Sara
Slattery (Portland, Ore.), and Rene Metivier (Boulder, Colo.), began to
gain ground on McGregor. As De Reuck and Russell emerged from the woods,
Russell made her final push to open up a five meter lead and take her
first USA Cross Country title running 26:47 to finish two seconds up on
De Reuck who made her fourth Team USA Cross Country squad. Metivier,
Slattery, McGregor and Sharon Thompson rounded out the top-six to
qualify for the U.S. team.

"I wanted to go out hard and get a good start. The course was good. When
I ran it yesterday, I didn't think that hill was all that bad; however,
the hill was a little harder than I thought. Colleen really pushed the
pace on the third lap. She'd take off on the uphill, and I'd come back
on her on the downhill. I think I'm going to run the 4km tomorrow,
unless I feel really beat up."

The USA Cross Country Championships presented by Gleukos will be
televised February 20 (late evening February 19) at 12:00 a.m. EST on
ESPN 2.
