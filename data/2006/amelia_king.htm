Between the running, jumping and throwing, Amelia King enjoys the variety and challenges that being a multi-sport athlete offers.
<p>“There are some events I like better than others&#151;long-distance, like the 1,500, because I have done that the longest,” says King, a 12-year-old who competes for the City Track Club of San Francisco in the youth girls division. “But I also like the high jump and hurdles.”
<p>During much of the regular track season, King runs the 100-meter hurdles, the 800 and 1,500 meters, and does the high jump. As the championship and qualifying meets approach, she hones the other skills she needs to compete in the pentathlon. The multi-sport event consists of an 800-meter run, shot put, high jump, long jump and 100-meter hurdles.<br>

In 2005, King qualified for the Junior Olympics in Indianapolis as a midget girl in the pentathlon and high jump. She has her sights set on the 2006 Junior Olympics in Baltimore and has been spending extra time working on her weak areas.<br><br>

<p>“Shot put is definitely my weakest point,” King says. “I’ve been coming early to practices, and my coach is helping me with that. It’s still not my strongest [area].”
<p>City Track Club Coach Otis Campbell credits King’s hard work and dedication for her success throughout the years. She comes to practice 30 minutes early and stays late. Assistant Coach Ken Black also works with King.
<p>“Her hurdling has gotten much better this year,” Campbell says. “She’s got the distance background, now we just have to work on her speed. Her high jump also is much better, and she improved by 4 to 6 inches this year.”
<p>King started competing in Pacific Association USA Track and Field meets several years ago, following in the steps of her older sister, Eve. Eve also qualified for Junior Olympics last year as an intermediate girl in the high jump, hurdles and heptathlon.
<p>Since her early years, Amelia King also has shown prowess as a middle distance runner, competing in the 1,500 and 3,000 meters in 2005 and the 1,500 meters this season. She has qualified for several Junior Olympic Cross-Country Championships, including the 2005 event in Smithfield, R.I.
<p>“I did cross-country before I did track,” King says. “My first season of running was cross-country, which is also what my sisters did. I enjoy it because you get to actually run somewhere rather than just around in circles.”
<p>King’s mother, Meridee Moore, credits Campbell for much of her two daughters’ successes in track and cross country.
<p>“Coach Campbell is so gentle&#151;he really inspires the kids,” Moore says. “He gets to know them and really respects them.”
<p>Since King took up running, Moore has seen a transformation in her daughter, who is a sixth grader at Marin Country Day School.
<p>“It’s been great because she was quiet and shy when she was in lower school,” Moore says. “When she got into middle school, it’s become her personality. She’s gained confidence and presence. [Running] is something she really calls her own.”
<p>Competing also has taught King good sportsmanship and how to loose graciously.
<p>“One of the things she’s learned is you always congratulate the kids in front of you and behind you,” Moore says. “There’s such a comradery with the 800- and 1,500-meter runners.”
<p>King says competition has taught her to be strong and persist. It’s also taught her about sacrifice.
<p>“It’s hard to keep it up because there’s also school, and I have to do well in school,” King says. “Between school and track and parties at my friends’, I’ve learned that you have to choose.”
