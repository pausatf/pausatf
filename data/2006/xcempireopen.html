			<p>Starting off the cross county season, this year's Empire Open presents a beautiful new course--a 3.43 mile variation of the traditional Sonoma County high school X-C championship course in Santa Rosa's Spring Lake Park.&nbsp; This course offers a much better start/finish area than our old Windsor course and includes mostly wide dirt trails,&nbsp;approximately 10% paved bike paths,&nbsp;and a few moderate hills.</p>
			<p><b>Technical T-shirts will be presented to the top 10 finishers in each of the women's, men's masters, and men's open races.</b>&nbsp;</p>
			<p><b>Post-race refreshments!&nbsp;</b></p>
