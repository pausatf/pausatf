<font size="5"><b>Delta Bay Buccaneers add track<br>to football and cheer offerings</b></font>
<br><br>
<font size="3"> <b>By Vicky Boyd</b><br><br>

The <b>Delta Bay Buccaneers</b> may be new to the Pacific Association of USA Track and Field’s youth program. But the Pittsburgh team is anything but a newcomer to youth sports.<br><br>
	The nonprofit Delta Bay Buccaneers Association was founded in 2004 to offer Pop Warner football and cheer to Contra Costa County area youth. It is governed by a board of directors comprising participants’ parents.<br><br>
	This year, association members decided to expand the program to offer track and field opportunities to youth ages 2 to 18. Next year, they hope to also offer a youth basketball program.<br><br>
	“Our ultimate goal is to have a year-round program to give the kids something to do every part of the year,” says Reggie Huey, Delta Bay track and field athletic director and Mitey Mite head coach.<br><br>
	Reggie and his wife, Robin, who serves as Delta Bay association president, have five children, four of whom participate in the Pop Warner and track and field programs.<br><br>
	Track complements the football and cheer programs by helping athletes build strong legs and improve endurance. But Reggie says they are free to participate in one sport and not the other.<br><br>
	“What we want is for track, football, cheer and basketball to run independently,” Reggie says. “We want kids who want to do a bunch of things. But we also want kids who will concentrate on one thing.”<br><br>
	Last fall, about 150 to 200 youth participated in the Delta Bay Pop Warner program. Surprisingly, about 50 signed up for the track program this winter, and Robin says they didn’t even advertise.<br><br>
	Although some of the Delta Bay board members were nervous about expanding into track, Reggie says he found the process relatively painless.<br><br>
	He and Robin provided three tips they found helpful when starting a track and field program.<br><br>
	<b>1. You need to have a group of people who want to start a track team and are truly committed to it.</b> And that includes the coach, Reggie says, citing Delta Bay’s head track coach Glen Coats as an example.<br><br>
	“You have to have that one lead person who is going to coach all the time and has the time,” Reggie says. “You have to make sure you have people who are committed to the excellence of the whole program.”<br><br>
	<b>2. You need to have a practice facility.</b> The Hueys say the Delta Bay Bucks were fortunate that Pittsburgh High School offered its all-weather track. The community of Pittsburgh had wanted a youth track and field program for some time.<br><br>
	“We approached the head coach at Pittsburgh High, and he was so excited to help us out,” Reggie says.<br><br>
	<b>3. You need an umbrella association, such as PA USATF, to guide you along the way.</b><br><br>
	“Maura [Kent] at Roseville has been so wonderful,” Robin says. “She has given me so much information.” Kent is the PA USATF’s Youth Committee communications chair.<br><br>
	Reggie agrees. “Even before our first meeting, I told them I was interested in starting a track club. I asked, ‘What do I need to do?’ I got this list from A to Z on what to do. It was so easy.”<br><br>

<font size="5"><b>Central Valley Roadrunner's Move<br>to 1,500 puts the 
FUN Back in Running</B></font>

<font size="3"><BR><BR><BR><b>By Vicky Boyd</b><BR><BR>Two years ago, <B>Andrew 
Osgood</B> was a middle-of-the-pack sprinter in the 100-, 200- and 400-meter 
runs. But a change of scenery and a move to the 800- and 1,500-meter runs this 
year has made the difference for this Central Valley Roadrunner.<BR><BR>The 
Modesto resident took first in the midget boys' 1,500 meter-run at the East Bay 
Heat Sectionals in Berkeley, March 25, with 5:22:25. He also anchored the 
Roadrunners' A 4x800 relay team to a win with 11:33. Andrew ran his leg in 2:43. 
<BR><BR>Andrew repeated his first-place 1,500 performance on April 1, winning by 
a nose at the B# Track Club Sectionals in Hercules with a personal record of 
5:16. Earlier that same day, he came in a close second in the 800 with a p.r. of 
2:37.<BR><BR>Andrew says he decided to try longer distances after attending high 
school track meets with his mother, Jana, who is head track coach at Downey High 
School in Modesto.<BR><BR>He also likes the mental part of the 
sport.<BR><BR>"There's more of a strategy than just running all out," Andrew 
says of the 1,500. "It's more of what do I do the first 400 and the last 
400?"<BR><BR>Since Andrew took up the longer distances this season, his father, 
Scott, has seen a difference in his son's outlook.<BR><BR>"The coaching has 
helped him night and day," Scott says. "He loves to go to track every night. 
He's always motivated. It's the most fun he's ever had."<BR><BR>Scott also has 
noticed a newfound confidence in his 11-year-old.<BR><BR>"He feels like now he 
knows he can do it," Scott says. "Every time he goes out now, he knows he can do 
better." <BR><BR>Andrew already has goals for the remainder of the season. 
Within the next few meets, he plans to run below 5:10 in the 1,500, his favorite 
event. He also hopes to go to the USA Track and Field Junior Olympics in 
Baltimore, Md., in July, but he admits it will take hard work.<BR><BR>"I'll talk 
with friends off the track when we're getting ready, but when I get on the 
track, I am focused and my goal is to be first across the finish line," Andrew 
says.<BR><BR>And with his positive attitude and work ethic, Andrew has a good 
chance of achieving his goals, says Roadrunners distance coach Jeff 
Lozano.<BR><BR>"Some kids have the fire in their eyes," Lozano says. "Some kids 
have the fire in their heart, and Andrew has both. He's also always willing to 
learn."<BR><BR><i>If you know a Pacific Association USA Track and Field
