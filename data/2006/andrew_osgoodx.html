<font size="5"><b>Central Valley Roadrunner's Move to 1,500 puts the 
FUN Back in Running</B></font>

<font size="3"><BR>
<BR><BR><b>By Vicky Boyd</b><BR><BR>Two years ago, <B>Andrew 
Osgood</B> was a middle-of-the-pack sprinter in the 100-, 200- and 400-meter 
runs. But a change of scenery and a move to the 800- and 1,500-meter runs this 
year has made the difference for this Central Valley Roadrunner.<BR><BR>The 
Modesto resident took first in the midget boys' 1,500 meter-run at the East Bay 
Heat Sectionals in Berkeley, March 25, with 5:22:25. He also anchored the 
Roadrunners' A 4x800 relay team to a win with 11:33. Andrew ran his leg in 2:43. 
<BR><BR>Andrew repeated his first-place 1,500 performance on April 1, winning by 
a nose at the B# Track Club Sectionals in Hercules with a personal record of 
5:16. Earlier that same day, he came in a close second in the 800 with a p.r. of 
2:37.<BR><BR>Andrew says he decided to try longer distances after attending high 
school track meets with his mother, Jana, who is head track coach at Downey High 
School in Modesto.<BR><BR>He also likes the mental part of the 
sport.<BR><BR>"There's more of a strategy than just running all out," Andrew 
says of the 1,500. "It's more of what do I do the first 400 and the last 
400?"<BR><BR>Since Andrew took up the longer distances this season, his father, 
Scott, has seen a difference in his son's outlook.<BR><BR>"The coaching has 
helped him night and day," Scott says. "He loves to go to track every night. 
He's always motivated. It's the most fun he's ever had."<BR><BR>Scott also has 
noticed a newfound confidence in his 11-year-old.<BR><BR>"He feels like now he 
knows he can do it," Scott says. "Every time he goes out now, he knows he can do 
better." <BR><BR>Andrew already has goals for the remainder of the season. 
Within the next few meets, he plans to run below 5:10 in the 1,500, his favorite 
event. He also hopes to go to the USA Track and Field Junior Olympics in 
Baltimore, Md., in July, but he admits it will take hard work.<BR><BR>"I'll talk 
with friends off the track when we're getting ready, but when I get on the 
track, I am focused and my goal is to be first across the finish line," Andrew 
says.<BR><BR>And with his positive attitude and work ethic, Andrew has a good 
chance of achieving his goals, says Roadrunners distance coach Jeff 
Lozano.<BR><BR>"Some kids have the fire in their eyes," Lozano says. "Some kids 
have the fire in their heart, and Andrew has both. He's also always willing to 
learn."<BR><BR><i>If you know a Pacific Association USA Track and Field
