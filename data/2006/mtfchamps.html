<b>Pacific Association USATF Masters Track and Field Championships<br>
			California State University, Sacramento<br>
		
July 1</b><br>
	<br>
More than 400 competitors are expected for the Pacific Association of USATF Masters Track and Field Championships on Saturday, July 1, 2006 at California State University, Sacramento.  The meet is hosted by Brooks Fleet Feet Racing, Sacramento and will be held at the same world-class facility that has hosted the 2000 and 2004 U.S. Olympic Trials for Track and Field and will host the 2006 NCAA Championships June 7-10. <br>
<br>
The meet will feature all standard field events and track events from 100 meters through 5000 meters. The schedule includes a 2000-meter steeplechase for women and men 60-and over; a 3000-meter steeplechase for men 59 and younger; and a 5000-meter race walk for both men and women. The event will also feature three popular meet-ending relays: the 4 x 100, 4 x 800 and 4 x 400. <br>
<br>
Team scoring and, for the first time, team prize money will help the meet attract the top PA teams who regularly compete in the road and cross country grand prix circuits and other teams and athletes from up and down the west coast. The PA meet is five weeks before the USATF Outdoor Masters Championships in Charlotte, North Carolina, and could be an early preview of the battle for the outdoor national team title. <br>
<br>
Trophies and prize money will be awarded to the first three teams scoring the most points in all the men's and women's age groups combined. The first place team will receive $250, second place $150, and third $100.  The top six finishers in each five year age group will score for their team. <br>
<br>
Open athletes are welcome to compete but will not receive individual awards or score team points. <br>
