Subject: Bob Mathias is very ill, wants calls and cards<br>
<br>
Bob Mathias, one of our greatest living Olympians, is at home in Fresno battling cancer, and he would welcome calls and cards from Olympians and friends. He goes to Stanford once a week for experiental chemotherapy. His home address is 7469 Pine Avenue, Fresno, CA 93727 and his phone is (559) 456-9245. His wife, Gwen, says he would love to hear from people because it lifts his spirits. <br> 
<br> 
Please distribute this as widely as you can, so that we might get some calls and cards going for Bob at home. 
<br>
Many thanks, 
<br>
Mike Moran<br>
