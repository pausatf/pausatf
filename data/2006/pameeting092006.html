BACKGROUND CHECKS<br>
- Phil Watkins not present (had a track meet conflict) but reported that a finger print check is the best option.<br>
- How extensive should check be: county? state? national?<br>
- Possible to do our own fingerprinting then send them to be put on file; could be a little as $10 per check for national level. Might need to hire someone to do this.<br>
- Info on costs needed for 2007 budget.<br>
- Badges need to be made; Charlie Shepard has a program for doing this.<br>
<br>
2006 NCAA T&amp;F CHAMPIONSHIPS   June 7-10<br>
