					Oppressive heat, dripping humidity, and lightning bolts could not prevent Pacific Association athletes from earning a 
new World record, two American records, and over 120 medals, 45 of them gold, at the 2006 National Masters Track and Field 
Championships.  The event, held August 3-6 in Charlotte, NC at the Irwin Belk Center, drew approximately 1400 competitors 
from across the country, including 70 from the Pacific Association.

				<p><font size="3">Thirty six athletes from Brooks-Fleet Feet Racing in Sacramento made the trip in order to raise funds to help a teammate's 
ailing daughter and defend their 2005 team title. The team scored 637 points to outdistance the Florida Athletic Club (393) 
and SoCal-Fleet Feet (332). With several pledges for both team points and personal records, more than $4,000 was raised for 
Dianne McCarthy and her daughter Brianna.<br>

				<p><font size="3">“I was really proud of our team. They competed hard for four days under difficult circumstances with the heat, humidity 
and schedule changes, said coach Randy Sturgeon. ”Yet, they kept a very positive attitude and did all they could to help 
a teammate and her daughter.”

				<p><font size="3">Brooks-Fleet Feet's Karen Kunz (in photo to the right) teamed up with top runners from across the country to break the 50-59 4 x 800 World record, 
clocking a speedy time of 10:27.04.   The previous listed mark of 10:33.26 was set by a Dutch team in 1999.  Karen also 
eclipsed her own pending American record in the 50-54 2000 meter steeplechase with a time of 8:31.15.  She finished second 
in the 1500, 5000, and 10,000 and third in the 800.  Kathleen Shook, also of Brooks-Fleet Feet, set a new American standard 
in the 400 meter hurdles with a very fast 1:09.38. In addition, Kathleen won the 400 meter dash, finished second in the 200, 
third in the 100, anchored her club s gold medal 4 x 100 relay squad, and leapt to a second place finish in the high jump.

				<p><font size="3">Other noteworthy accomplishments include a sprint triple-gold by Joy Upshaw-Margerum (photo on right) in the 45-49 100 and 200 meter dashes and the 80 hurdles (she also placed second in the long jump) and a distance triple by Roger Busch in the 30-34 5000, 10,000, and 3,000 steeple. Amazingly, Roger won the steeple a mere 30 minutes after winning the 10 km! 75-year-old Edythe Leek prevailed in the 100, 200 and 400 meter dashes and high jump. She also medaled or placed in five other field events.<br>
