	First Open Meet At New CSM Track Facility: PA CHAMPIONSHIPS &amp; $15 K GRAND PRIX SUN. MAY 28<br><br>
	CONCLUDES LOCAL T&amp;F SEASON<br><br>
	The first open competition on College of San Mateo's new Mondo Track will be USA Track &amp; Field's Pacific Association Championships and Grand Prix Competition on Sunday, May 28.<br> <br>

The full slate of events gets underway at 9 a.m. with a combined men's and women's 10,000 meter race and concludes at 3:45 p.m. with the men's 200 meters. 

<br> <br> 

The meet will award double points in the season-long PA Grand Prix, which has $15,000 at stake.  

<br> <br> 

Former Stanford shot putter Jill Camarena won the 2005 PA women's Grand Prix and $1,700 ahead of   Olympic long jumper Grace Upshaw out of Cal, who pocketed $1,300.  Former Cal hurdler Tim Bogdanof took the men's competition over sprinter Jeff Laynes (out of USC and Merritt College) for similar cash prizes. 

<br> <br> 

Current GP leaders are men's middle distance runner Jim Sorensen, with 3,858 points, and women's distance runner Johanna Bonfiglio, with 3,982 points.  

<br> <br> 

Scores are based upon an athlete's five best point totals during the season, utilizing the official international (IAAF) scoring tables.  Several athletes have only posted three scores to date.   They can still tally points in the Pacific Association Championships and in other meets leading up to the USA Championships in Indianapolis, June 20-25.  Athletes earn bonus points for their performances at the nationals.                 
<br> <br>

Both are Cal grads.
