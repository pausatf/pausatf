Hi Everybody! <br>
<br>It's that time again-- time to gather up all the Pacific Association news and photos that you've been saving and submit them to California Track &amp; Running News for the January/February 2007 issue. Please note that the submission deadline is: <b>THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 16</b>, 2006. As always, I ask that you not wait until the deadline to submit anything that you have ready now, especially since the following week is Thanksgiving!<br>   
<br>
In the past, I have been flexible about late submissions, in many cases redoing already completed pages to accommodate them.  <b>Beginning with this issue, anything received after the deadline will not, in all likelihood, make publication. </b><br>
<br>
		Another important note: don't forget that my new email is <a href="mailto: ctrneditorial@gmail.com"> ctrneditorial@gmail.com </a><br>
			<br>
		Always be sure to include a photo caption and a photo credit with your photographs submissions.
		<p><br>
			Thanks for your hard work in continuing to provide stories, schedules, and photos. I know that our readers--your members--appreciate it!<br>
			<br>
