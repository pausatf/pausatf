USATF announces New York Road Runners as Presenting Sponsor of
USA Distance Project <br>

NEW YORK, N.Y. -USA Track & Field announced on Monday that the New York
Road Runners (NYRR), host of the 2006 USA Cross Country Championships
presented by Gleukos, has signed as a Presenting Sponsor of the USA
Distance Project for the next year. <br>
<br>
The purpose of the USA Distance Project is to increase the opportunities
for, and the number of, U.S. long distance running athletes by creating
a network of training environments and activities which will produce
more world class American marathoners and distance stars.<br>
<br>
As a Presenting Sponsor, NYRR will provide $240,000 in financial support
for the USA Distance Project and USA Distance Centers around the
country. <br>
<br>
"The New York Road Runners have shown a great commitment to the sport of
long distance running and particularly the development of American
distance running stars," said Craig Masback, CEO of USA Tack & Field.
"The partnership of USATF and leaders of the running industry like the
New York Road Runners will be of tremendous value in helping our
athletes to realize their potential and take on the World."<br>
<br>
With the new support of partners such as NYRR, the USA Distance Project
will provide yearly funding to the existing network of USA Distance
Centers as well as support athlete and coaching summits leading up to
major international competitions. This partnership will maintain a
collective commitment to developing athletes through the next Olympiad
and beyond.<br>
<br>
"This is another big step forward in our support of American long
distance running. This is a statement of our belief in American distance
running," said Mary Wittenberg President and CEO of NYRR. "We have every
confidence we have the talent to win Olympic marathon medals and to win
big city marathon titles and we want to do all we can to make that
happen." <br>
<br>
A partnership of the Long Distance Running Division of USA Track and Field
and major U.S. events and running related corporations, the USA Distance
Project is devoted to sustaining the long-term development of elite USA
distance athletes, enabling them to compete successfully in domestic and
international competitions and major championship events. USA Distance
Center programs such as Team Running USA, the Big Sur Distance Project
and Team USA Minnesota have made significant progress toward bolstering
the strength of U.S. long distance running. The newly expanded program
will ensure that they are supported through the next quadrennium. <br>
<br>
The current Team USA Distance Centers that will benefit from this
support are Team USA Minnesota, The Big-Sur Distance Project, Team
Running USA and the new Boulder Performance Training Group. <br>
