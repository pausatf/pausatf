									<li>If a club wants to invite or permit an unattached athlete to practice a few times the unattached athlete is covered vicariously for those few times.&nbsp; During this tryout, the athlete must be a current USATF member and&nbsp;should bring proof of membership before attending.&nbsp; Beyond that, a decision needs to be made to join and no more tryouts allowed for the remaining year.&nbsp; Coverage cannot extend indefinitely.
									<li>Each club should set their own policy for &quot;Tryouts&quot; for unattached USATF member athletes.&nbsp; Tryouts are at the risk of the insured club.
