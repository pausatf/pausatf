the appropriate page (road or cross country) of the Pacific Association
website, www.pausatf.org; this scoresheet automatically sends an email
to the official scorer. The name of each team member, including
non-scoring members, should be included on the scoresheets. Due to
imperfections in the scoresheet system, a team not initially scored
after the Wednesday deadline has two business days after the
preliminary posting of results by the scorer in which to submit a team
which was not scored. During this period only "automatic" drop-downs
may be used, that is, a person in a given age division will be treated
as belonging to the next younger age division if and only if (a) they
did not run fast enough to score for their team in their own age
division, (b) their team in their own age division did not have enough
runners to score a full team, or (c) they were not listed on a
timely-submitted scoresheet for their own age division. A runner
dropping down a division will be treated as if they were of the age of
the lower division for that race, and so may re-apply this rule and
continue to drop down until they find a division in which they might
score. Thus a super senior could score as an open runner under this
automatic drop down rule if the person did not run fast enough to score
on his or her super senior, senior, or masters team. </td>
