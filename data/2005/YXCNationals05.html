<h2><i>Pacific Association at the<br>
2005 National Junior Olympics<br>
Cross Country Championships</i></h2>

Saturday, December 10th
Smithfield, Rhode Island

By our standards there was a lot of snow and according to the Providence 
natives there was a lot of snow.  The Rhode Island annual weather figures 
called for a 5% chance of snow.  But the biggest plus on the weather was 
that the meet was not on Friday! 

Of the 1968 finishers 151 (7.6%) ran for the Pacific Association.  Of the 
250 individual medals (top 25 in each of the 10 age groups) 26 (10.4%) were 
won by our PA runners.  We had three second place finishers.  Of the 30 team 
medals (top 3 in each of the 10 age groups) three (10%) were awarded to PA 
teams, two were for first place.  When you realize that there are 57 
associations throughout the nation our athletes are well above the average.  
Last year there were 2420 finishers, 170 ran for the PA.  Please note that 
these numbers come from the result sheets which list only the finishers.  
We do not know if any runners did not finish the race or, because of the 
weather, did not start the race

By comparing the winning times with last year you can see what the snow can cause.  
Note that in the 5000m races the course was altered (shortened) because of very 
high snow in a very narrow area.
