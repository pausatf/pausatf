<h2>Youth athletes at World Jrs continued...</h2>
Team USA capped off an exciting opening day on Tuesday as
several U.S. athletes turn in impressive performances to advance in their
respective events. 
 
In the men's 400m preliminaries, South Carolina-bound Keith Hinnant was 
able to calm his nerves in his international competition debut to win his heat 
in a personal best time of 46.54 seconds, while East Carolina University-bound
LaShawn Merritt won his heat in 46.70 seconds. A Bayshore, NY native,
Hinnant's clocking is the second fastest time entering the semi-final 
round tomorrow. "I came out nervous in the beginning, as this is my first
international competition," said Hinnant. "My nerves went away at the 
start because I knew I just had to make the top three to qualify for the next
round." In the women's 400m, University of South Carolina-bound Natasha
Hastings turned in the fastest time of 52.61 to qualify for the next round
while teammate Ashlee Kidd of Georgia Tech also moved on in 53.56 to win
heat two.
 
In the 100m semi-finals, UNLV-bound Ashley Owens (11.35) and Mt. SAC-bound
Jasmine Baldwin (11.46) won their heats to qualify for the women's 100m
finals while fellow teammates Demi Omole of Wisconsin (10.19) and Central
High's (Texas) Ivory Williams (10.30) qualified for the men's 100m finals.
Cal-Berkley-bound Melissa Faubus qualified for the finals in the women's
discus after her 47.49m/155-9. University of Miami-bound Timothy Harris
advanced in the 800m after placing fourth (1:50.75) in his heat. In the
men's 1,500m, Cal-Berkeley's David Torrence advanced with a personal best
3:46.60 en route to a fourth-place finish in his heat. In the women's 
800m, LaTavia Thomas of West Catholic High (Phila, Pa.) finished third (2:07.17)
in a personal best time in heat three. In the women's triple jump
Stanford-bound Erica McClain leaped (13.30m/43-7.75) to qualify for the next round.
  
Cory Martin of Auburn (18.23m/59-9.75) and Justin Clickett of Pittsburgh
(18.10m/59-4.75) qualified for the men's shot put finals but did not medal.
 
In only his third year competing in track & field, Matt Carter of Santa 
Ana Junior College leaped 1.95m/6-4.75 to finish 12th in his section of the
men's high jump. "It was a mental thing for me today," said Carter. "My
approach was not as good as it should have been. I was coming to the bar
too slow, when it seemed like I was moving too fast." University of
Washington-bound Norris Frederick cleared 2.05m/6-8.75 in the men's high
jump in the semi-finals. Frederick also leaped 7.18m/23-6.75 to finish
eighth in his group in the men's long jump.
 
 
Other Team USA members who competed today, but did not advance included
3,000m steeplechasers Amber Harper of BYU (10:32.96) and Selina Sekulic of
Wake Forest (10:50.03), who finished sixth in their respective heats; 
Marcus Mayes of Missouri, who was sixth (1:53.18) in his heat in the 800 meters;
Mallory Webb of Fresno State, who placed 14th (42.89m/140-8) in her
qualifying round in the women's javelin; Trisha Nickoley bound for 
Missouri, who placed sixth (2:09.66) heat 1 of the women's 800m; Lindsey Grigoriev 
of Kansas State, who finished fifth (46.60m/152-11) in her section in the
women's discus throw; Kristen Callan of Virginia Tech, who finished 8th
(55.84m/183-2) in her section in the women's hammer throw; Yvette Lewis of
Hampton University who finished seventh in a personal best (12.96m/42-6.25)
in her section of the women's triple jump; and Russell Brown of Stanford
finished sixth (3:49.02) in his heat of the 1500m.

Athlete Quotes:
 
Caitlin Chock (5,000m) University of Richmond bound:
I wanted to go in the race and get a PR," said Chock. I had to pace 
myself  as I made up the time to catch one person at a time. I really surprised
myself and could not be happier.
 
Melissa Faubus (Discus Throw) Cal-Berkeley bound:
 
My technique was great, and I felt good, but my release is not what I
wanted. I'm trying to PR and move up in the standings. I'm excited for
tomorrow. It's been an awesome and enriching experience - with world
championship competition and the tremendous atmosphere here. I'm happy to
have made it into the Finals.
 
 
Matt Carter (High Jump) Santa Ana College:
 
It was a new experience for me to compete against international athletes.
It was a mental thing for me today. My approach was not as good as it
should have been. I was coming to the bar too slow, when it seemed like I
was moving too fast. I definitely won't miss next year!
 
 
Jasmine Baldwin (100m SF) Mt. SAC College- bound:
 
I really wasn't thinking about much besides focusing on the finish line. 
My start does need work, but if I'm trailing I always seem to find myself
coming back into the race. I don't panic. When I panic, I get tight and
don't run as well. I'm not a quitter. I'm a finisher.
 
 
Keith Hinnant: (400m) University of South Carolina-bound:
 
I came out nervous in the beginning, as this is my first international
competition. My nerves went away at the start because I knew I just had to
make the top three to qualify for the next round. I tried to maintain
phases and work off the people in front of me so I could pace myself. 
I'd rather work off the other athletes than them work off of me.
 
 
Ashley Owens (100m SF) UNLV-bound:
 
I'm trying to break the record this week (WJR record is 10.88, set in 1977
by Marlies Oelsner-Gohr; AJR is 11.04, by Angela Williams in 1999) and I
wanted to run faster in the semis than I did this morning. I was not as
focused this morning as I am now. I slowed down after the first 60 meters
to save energy when I should have ran all out. I tend to shut down when 
I'm in front.
 
 
Amber Harper (3,000 steeplechase) BYU:
 
I was not in the race from the beginning. It is hard for me to get in the
race when I don't start out good. I am tired because it has been a long
season, but I am definitely glad to be here.
 
 
Ivory Williams (100m) Central High (Beaumont, Texas):
 
I got out well and then was able to cruise on in to the finish, and save
energy for tomorrow. I will try to do better tomorrow.
 
 
David Torrance (1,500m) Cal-Berkeley:
 
I thought the race would be faster than the way it ended up. I wanted to
stay in the front pack as long as I could. With 300m to go, I decided to
make my move.
 
Natasha Hastings (400m) University of South Carolina-bound:
I did not feel that I was going as fast as I was which was a boost for my
confidence heading into the next round. My performance today lets me know
that I am shape and ready to break the 52 barrier. I definitely did not
plan to run 52.60 today.
 
 
Ashlee Kidd (400m) Georgia Tech University:
 
I felt good but ran conservative today to save my energy for the next 
round. My goal was to win my heat, which is what I did.
 
 
Marcus Mayes (800m) University of Missouri:
The race was really physical at first, which was something I was not
expecting. I really wanted to set the pace through the 200 and 400 
meters, but I allowed the physical part of the race through my rhythm off. It 
was a learning and growing experience given the conditions, I think I did well.
I'm glad to be here.
 
Norris Frederick (HJ & LJ) University of Washington bound:
My shoes ripped during my first attempt, so I had a hard time to adjusting
to my new shoes during the high jump.
 
I felt pretty good in the long jump. I kept leaning backwards every time 
I landed in the pit. My approach off the board went well going down the
runway.
