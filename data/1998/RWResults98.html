<B>The Pacific Association/USA Track and Field 10 Km Racewalk Open &amp; Master's</B>
<B>&gt;Championships and All Comers 5 Km</B> were held Sunday, May 3, 1998 in Palo
&gt;Alto, California.  This event was hosted by the Golden Gate Race Walkers. 
&gt;The conditions were cool, partly cloudy and calm.
&gt;
&gt;Three teams of three walkers per team entered into the Team Challenge.  The
&gt;teams are named for the commodities offered as prizes to the winning team. 
&gt;The winning team is determined by the highest age-graded percentage total
&gt;for the team.  A calculation of the percentages after the race was based on
&gt;table data that may have been from the first edition of the Age-Graded
&gt;Tables published by WAVA.  Calculation of these percentages by the current
&gt;edition produced a slightly different result for each competitor and
changed
&gt;the outcome of the winning team.  
&gt;
&gt;Team Challenge Results:
&gt;
&gt;Virgins: 234.7% (Extra virgin olive oil)
&gt;Dick Petruzzi, 81.5%; Bill Penner, 76.9%; Bill Moremen, 76.3%
&gt;
&gt;Cots: 231.8% (Apricots)
&gt;Hansi Rigney, 80.5%; Brierly Reybine, 76.7%; Lorraine Coppola, 74.6%
&gt;
&gt;Chocks: 207.5% (Giradelli chocolate)
&gt;John Doane, 72.8%; Art Klein, 69.4%; Gary Bower, 65.3%
