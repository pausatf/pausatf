Clarksburg 30K: ran once, 1:39:18 for 2nd 2003
Running Obstacles/Injuries: The greatest obstacle to my running that I have overcome 
was probably the Sacral Stress Fracture that took me out of the game for the fall of 2001.
Top Races: My best races have probably been the PA Champs cross-country races of 
the last two seasons. Both of these races have been all out efforts and although I finished 
9th in 2002 and 16th in 2003 I felt that I gave everything I had to both efforts. I'm also proud 
of my US Champs marathon in 2003 in Birmingham Alabama. I ran 2:21:26, finished 13th and 
qualified for the Olympic Trials.
Other Running Accomplishments: I won my debut marathon in 2002 in the San Francisco 
Chronicle Marathon running 2:31:46. I was 34th place at the USATF Winter Nationals Cross-country 
12k in 2001. And in 2002 I finally got to win my home cross-country invite when I won the Aggie invite in 24:37.
Other Accomplishments: I love the outdoors and running has been a great way to see some amazing things. 
I've run through the trails of Redwood National Park, to the top of Half Dome and down to the bottom of the
Grand Canyon from the North Rim. I had to walk out of there but I couldn't have done it without the fitness 
gained from running. 
Goals: I want to qualify for the next Olympic Trials marathon and significantly improve my place from this year. 
I want to run a race where I feel completely satisfied with my effort. And when I finally quit competitive running 
I want to remain active and continue to positively contribute to the sport and life, whether it be through coaching 
or some other means. 
Role Model: My role models include Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Robert Johnson, Thom Yorke of Radiohead, 
the members of U2, Crazy Horse, Dr. Hunter S. Thompson, T.S. Eliot, Bob Dylan, Sitting Bull, John Muir, Henry Rono, 
Charles Bukowski, Cormac McCarthy, Gabe Jennings, My friends, family, competitors, teammates, coaches and basically 
anyone who has brought positive energy and inspiration to my life.
Favorite Races: My top three favorites. 1. Anything in Golden Gate Park. 2. The Olympic Trials Marathon 
3.The Will Rogers 4th of July 10k in Pacific Palisades, California. 
Hobbies: I love to read, listen to music, go to concerts, camp, hike, climb mountains, drink beer, eat sushi, hang out with 
my girlfriend Steph, go to Applewood Pizza in Menlo Park with my good friends, or perhaps the Hiker's Hut in Sam McDonald 
County Park near La Honda. Sometimes just sitting in the sun talking to an old friend or BBQ'ing with my family are the best times 
of all. I guess I'm a man that appreciates simple pleasures.

Birth Date: 12/22/77
Birth place: Palo Alto, CA
Resident City: Berkeley
Club: Adidas Transports
Education: UC Berkeley
Job: rocket scientist
Years Running: 11
High school: St. Francis High School
College: UC Berkeley
College Running: 2-time Pac Ten scorer in 1500 meters
Texas relays 1500 meter champion
Personal Records: 
1500: 3:45 at Stanford Invite 2003
5K: 14:27 at Stanford Invite 2002
10K: 31:30 at Heritage Oaks 10K 2003
Other: 1:51 800 meters 2001
Grand Prix Races:
Cal 10 Stockton: ran once, 53:20, 2002
Fleet Feet Mile:ran 3 times, 4:14 for 2nd 2002
Jamba Juice 5K: ran twice, 15:01 for 9th 2003
Heritage Oaks 10K: ran twice, 31:30 2003
Top Races: During college, whenever I ran at Mt. Sac, 
I always seemed to run a P.R. I enjoy running night races. 
For Cross Country the last few years, for whatever reason, 
I usually do well at Shoreline.
Other Running Accomplishments: I won the Bridge to Bridge 7K in 2002.
Other Accomplishments: In the beginning of 2003, I visited the small east 
African nation of Eritrea for a month. It was an amazing experience and difficult 
to explain. It was my first time in a third world country. The water would be turned 
off for days at a time. The best runs I have ever or will ever go on. People didn't 
speak much English though, it was a lot of frantic hand gestures and embarrasement. 
Best moment: As the only white guy at a wedding of three hundred people, getting 
up and dancing (horribly) and receiving thundrous praise.
Goals: I would like to solve the world's energy problems.
Role Models: Since running is not a sport every boy or girl grows up dreaming about 
at a young age, the relationship between up and coming runners and the "stars" of the 
sport is different. I suppose it is simply the people around me that I respect as runners 
that I would call my role models. To name a few in order that I met them: Dave Frank, 
Peter Gilmore, Richie Boulet, Bolota Asmermom. There are more, but why flatter them?
Favorite Races: Mt. Sac track.
Stanford distance carnivals, whatever their name happens to be (Invite, qualifier, invitational)
Shoreline Cross Country meet
The East Bay Penetration
Hobbies: Isn't running interesting enough?

Injuries/obstacles/milestones: My major milestone is spending 6 years with my wife, Aimee, 
while being marreid for 1. She is the reason I am still running and not sitting on the couch...
Top Races: As a post collegiant my top races have been:
XC: The Willamette Inv. in 2002 when I placed 6th in 23:51.
37:05 for 12k at Across the Bay in 03 to PR by 2mins. 
31:20 at Run to Feed the Hungry after finaly get back in shape in 03 after being hurt for a while.
Goals: To run well and improve my place and time on the PA road circit in 04. 
I would also like to run PR's on the track in the 1500 and 5k and maybe run my first 10k on the track.
Role Models: My running role models are the guys who have kept running after college, 
held down jobs, and found a way to stay motivated to train on their own and run fast.
It's also fun to follow guys like Ritz and Webb who are on their way to some big things. 
Favorite Races: NCAA XC Meet
Stanford and Oregon Inv.
Hobbies: My biggest interest outside of running is snowboarding. I picked it up last year (03) and it 
seems I would rather going snowboarding anyday instead of a hard 10 miler. I now make sure I go on 
a run before snowboarding!
