TO: ALL PACIFIC ASSOCIATION CLUBS


FROM: John Mansoor, Executive Director


RE: RENEWALS


Enclosed you will find a club renewal form for the year 2004. As in 2003, the club dues remain $75.00 per 
club for the calendar year. Please fill out the club form completely and return to us with your fee. Note that incomplete forms will not be processed. 

Also enclosed is a practice insurance form for those clubs needing this. As in 2003, the practice insurance 
certificate will cost $15.00 per certificate for the calendar year. Also required for this is the club coach's 
resume, schedule of practices (days/hours), and a criminal background check for those clubs that have 
members under the age of 19. For those needing a background check please fill out the USATF 
membership form and return this with $20.00 for each check required. All coaches/volunteers/parents who will be in a supervisory position on each team with athletes under the age of 19 must be checked. 

PLEASE NOTE THAT UNTIL YOUR CLUB DUES ARE PAID FOR YEAR 2004 YOU ARE NOT 
ELIGIBLE FOR SCORING IN PACIFIC ASSOCIATION GRAND PRIX COMPETITION AND NOT 
ELIGIBLE FOR VOTING ON ANY COMMITTEES.

As in year 2003 you have access to your membership via our website at PAUSATF.org. We are now 
listing all registered Pacific Association members on our website. This allows you to know who has 
registered for your club. Athletes are listed in alphabetical order under their club. We hope that this will allow you to keep better track of your club members.

For year 2004 we will use broadcast email for communication to all our members who supply us with an 
email address. On the club form, and on the USATF membership form, we have asked for your email 
address. Once you have supplied us with this we will be able to send out information electronically which 
will reduce the time involved for communication and reduce costs. We plan on using this function as 
much as possible. We can make this available to you for meet/race announcements and other important 
information. For those that do not have email yet, we will send information via USPS.

Finally, for year 2004, on our website, we are offering on-line registration for individual members. You 
will need to use a credit card for this. You will receive an electronic confirmation with your membership number immediately and the data will be transferred automatically to my office and Indianapolis where a membership card will be issued and mailed to you. Please let your members know about this opportunity.

Thanks and best of luck in 2004!
