As the qualifying window closes for track & field events at the Olympic
Games, Team USA's roster (below) stands at 120 athletes. It is a roster
that is younger than any USA Olympic track & field team since 1992.
 
Since the U.S. Olympic Track & Field Trials July 9-18 in Sacramento, the
final roster in some events was yet to be determined as athletes
attempted to achieve Olympic A and B standards. The roster now includes
Rose Richmond (women's long jump), Tim Broe (men's 5,000 meters), Carrie
Tollefson (women's 1,500m), Charlie Gruber (men's 1,500m) and A.G.
Kruger (men's hammer throw), all of whom achieved Olympic standards
after the conclusion of the Olympic Trials.

The age game 
 
With an average age of 26.8, the 2004 U.S. Olympic track & field team is
the youngest since 1992, reversing a trend of older average ages. Since
1988, the average age of the team has risen from 24.8 in 1988 to 26.1 in
1992, 27.1 in 1996 and an all-time high, 28.5, in 2000. 
 
The 2004 men's Olympic Team has an average age of 26.4 years, while the
women average 27.4 years old. It continues a trend of the women's team
being older than the men's team in every Olympiad beginning in 1992, and
five of the last six (in 1988, the women's team was 25.0 years old
compared to 26. 8 for the men). While the age of the men's team has
varied, the women's team got steadily older from 1976 through 2000,
rising from 21.6 in '76 to 29.2 in 2000 - the oldest Olympic Team of
either gender in history.
 
The women also feature age extremes on the 2004 women's and men's
combined roster: 18-year-old Olympic Trials 200m champion Allyson Felix
is the youngest athlete on the team, while at age 41, Olympic Trials
women's 20 km race walk champion Teresa Vaill is the oldest female U.S.
track & field Olympian in history. The youngest athlete on the men's
team in 20-year-old 400m champion Jeremy Wariner; the oldest is race
walker Curt Clausen (36).
 
Other age notables:
 
* 47 athletes on the 120-athlete roster are age 25 or under
 
* The most common age is 27, with 16 athletes of that age.
Fourteen athletes are 26, twelve are 25 and ten are 21. The next
most-common age is 31, with nine athletes.
 
* The combined median age (equal # younger and older) is 27
