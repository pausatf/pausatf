								</div>
								<ul type="disc">
									<li>To obtain the latest version of Club Manager please contact Anthony Camargo at <a href="mailto:pa.youthentries@yahoo.com">pa.youthentries@yahoo.com</a>.
										<ul type="circle">
											<li>Club 4-digit codes can be located on the PA/USATF website in the Youth drop down list at <a href="http://www.pausatf.org/data/YTF4_letter_codes.html">http://www.pausatf.org/data/YTF4_letter_codes.html</a>.&nbsp; If your club is not listed contact Anthony Camargo at <a href="mailto:pa.youthentries@yahoo.com">pa.youthentries@yahoo.com</a>&nbsp; for a 4-digit code for your club
											<li>All 4-digit codes should be in CAPS
											<li>All unattached athletes use &ldquo;UNA&rdquo; as their code
										</ul>
									<li>Load all youth athletes, their 2009 USATF numbers, birth date and their best times / marks
									<li>Create a Meet Manager file using the &ldquo;Create Meet Manager File&rdquo; button and save it using your club name or unattached athlete&rsquo;s name

											<li>No changes will be accepted after this deadline
										</ul>
									
								</ul>
								<div>
									<p>How do the Junior Olympic (JO) Individual Entry Forms work?</p>
								</div>
								<ul type="disc">
									<li>3-part forms are available by going to the Youth Track &amp; Field schedule
									<li>Prior to the PA/JO, each athlete (club member or unattached) is required to have their JO advancement form validated by the Youth Membership Chairperson. Validation is to ensure an athlete is competing in the correct age group and has a current year of USATF membership. The act of validation is a stamp that is placed on each form.
									<li>Forms must be mailed in with your registration money order.&nbsp; They cannot be submitted the day of the meet when you pick up your club packet
								</ul>
								<div>
									<p>Packet Pick-up for a Championship Meet</p>
								</div>
								<ul type="disc">
									<li>When you arrive at packet pick-up remember to bring your PA Youth Committee binder which contains a copy of proof of birth documents sorted in alphabetical order by athlete&rsquo;s last name (not sorted by age division). It is always recommended that you have one extra copy of each proof of birth in case the Youth Membership Chair does not have it on file.
									<li>Check the PA/USATF website (http://www.pausatf.org/data/members.php) to verify your proof of birth for each athlete. If their name does not show up, you will need to provide a copy of their proof of birth to Tony Williams. The website is updated weekly. Please do not send any proof of birth to the main PA office in Folsom two weeks prior to the JO&rsquo;s.
									<li>Be ready to produce verification of the current year's USATF membership numbers for each youth athlete. Check http://www.pausatf.org/indexclubsa.php to verify that your athletes are listed under your team. Unattached athletes can find their membership number listed in the unattached roster. Print your roster and bring with you to packet pick-up.
