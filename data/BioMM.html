Injuries/obstacles/Other:  Married to Christine Olen 10 years, 

2 dogs Kayla (Irish Setter) and Annie (Golden Retreiver).

Set PR's at Cal-10 this year, PA-XC, Sierra, Tamalpa, Shoreline last season. 

Finally able to train year round for the first time since 1988. 

Reflects in my improvement during cross country and the first couple of race this year, 

and recent workouts indicate there is more in the tank than I imagined. I guess that 

16 year break was just the ticket. 

I have struggled with a chronic hamstring injury that affected me beginning after 

Crystal Springs in '02 and I injured it again at Zippy's last year. Thank goodness 

I married a physical therapist.

Top Races: National Masters Fall XC, 1996 10th, 1998 7th.

National Master Winter XC, 1999, 10th 2001, 7th.

Cal 10, 2004 2nd 45+. 

Running Accomplishments: Assistant coach at Seaside High School, 1980-81. 

Coached CCS champion, school record holder 2 mile, had 4 runners under 10 minutes for 2 miles.

Assistant coach at Boise State University 1987-92. Coached school record holder in mens 800, 

womens school record holders in the 800, 1500, mile, 3K, 5K, 10K, 4x800 (conference champs) 

distance medley. Met my future wife!

Other Accomplishments: Worked 16 years as a fire fighter, and from 1992-2002 was a smokejumper 

for the Bureau of Land Management. 

My first fire season I was in Yellowstone and pretty much was hooked from that point on to the 

adventure and excitement of it all. In 1992 at age 36, I was accepted into the rookie training program 

for the BLM smokejumpers and traveled to Fairbanks, Alaska. 

Making it through the training was one of the most satisfying accomplishments in my life. 

The physical training standards are rigorous: 1.5 mile in 9:30, 10 pull-ups, 35 push-ups, 60 sit-ups, 

110 lb. packout over 3 miles in an hour and a half, and a 45 lb. packout in 45 minutes the first day 

(and these are the minimums!). My PR's for those 2 are 47:18 and 22:36 respectively, but I wouldn't 

reccomend that anyone try that for a workout.

For the most part, fighting the fires wasn't nearly as frightening as exiting out of an aircraft at 3000 ft., 

and steering your parachute to a spot that may be rock strewn or the possibility of getting blown into 

the fire. Plus, with all the gear we exit the plane with you add an additional 100-120 lbs. to your normal 

body weight. 

I was fortunate enough to finish my smokejumper career with 217 jumps and no broken femur, burns, 

or any other serious injuries. I did tear a meniscus on a fire in 1997, but it only hurts when I run.;-)

Goals: Continue running and competing in the masters ranks. Really looking foprward to turning 50 

and escaping the hoards of newly minted 40 year olds!

Role Models: Pre, my JC coach Dave Stern.

Favorite Races: Midnight Sun Run, Fairbanks, any race at Hayward Field, any cross country race 

except in Greensboro or Houston.

Big Sur River Run, any race in The City. 

Hobbies: Golf, fishing, hunting (big game and upland game birds), hiking, mountain biking, staying 

away from high places like ladders and bridges.

What got you started running?: The '72 Olympics probably had an influence.

Getting cut from basketball also helped.



Personal Info:  After many years living and 

practicing law in Palo Alto, I moved to Tahoe in summer 2002. 

I was in very good shape at the time and the extra boost I got 

from being at altitude at first seemed like magic. Now I've learned 

that just being up here doesn't mean that much and good results 

take a lot of hard work. Darn.

Favorite Races: Road mile.

Hobbies: I'm a latecomer to skiing, both xc skating and downhill and enjoy both. 

Notwithstanding the fact that I stink.

club and it's supportive members.

Other Experiences: All in training: While on a long run in the hills rising above the fogline 

6am on Sunday morning. Pounding 5 miles of down hill leaning into the turns like a race at 

Laguna Seca. Running into headwinds on a down hill and having it pick me up as if flying. 

In Competing: Having the starting gun go off while still 100 yards in front of the starting line...Oops

Hitting the Wall at mile 18 duing my 1st marathon in 97. Actually still quallified for Boston (??) 

Passing the 20k mark at Clarkspur 30k in record time only to crash into the wall at mile 14!! Ouch. 

Goals: Breaking 4:30 in the Mile is a Goal I've had for years. I know I've been trained and able in 

the past. It's time to go out and do it.

I hope to give back to the sport. I hope to stay dedicated to be involved with the sport for a very long time.

Role Models: Howard Powers who never quits.

Todd Hayes who loves running as much (or more) than me.

applications requiring computer art. Just bought a motorcyle with 1100cc engine and enjoy it very much. 

Almost as much as running ("not!"). But what a kick!

Years Running: 10

High school: St. Louis Park High School, MN

HS Running: Lake Conference titles in X-C and track 2mile, 

a few of the same in District and Region, a few State Meet medals.

Two mile track best of 9:18, I think. High school XC course record 

at Lake Nokomis, 14:52 for 3 miles.

As a senior, a 10th grader named Steve Placensia went 0 for whatever 

against me. Didn't seem to hold him back later.

I graduated at 17, and don't recall anyone my age beating me. 

Steve Holl was also in the conference, maybe a year ahead of me.

College: University of Texas, Austin

College Running: Not many- I dropped out in the 3rd semester.

I did help to win the SW Conference XC team crown as a freshman, 

and got to run the NCAA meet, barely 18.

A few half decent times on the track, 1,3, & 6 miles.

Top Races: 2002 and 2003 were poor, due partly to injuries. My luck finally ran out.

Over the last five years my best results have been at 5k & 8k, esp. Big Sur and Shriners. 

Several years ago I finally got the age-graded tables, and realized some of my results 

still matched my good years of 95-96.

Other Accomplishments: Help in a small way to administer the Pacific Association of USATF, 

as well as the USATF Masters LDR Committee.

Assist in producing the Zippy 5K.

Other Adventures: Traveling with Don Paul is always an adventure, and I have had several.

Goals: Get very fit this year, and turn 50 with a bang.

Role Model: Ron Clarke

Favorite Races: Peachtree 10K: hospitality & organization second to none.

Twin Cities Marathon, Big Sur 5K, Zippy 5K, Shriners 8K.

When I used to travel and win my plane fare, the events in towns and smaller 

cities were the best. In Utica, Spokane, Tupelo, Appleton, and Tulsa, we were 

the center of attention; and I got to see places I might otherwise miss.

Races in the South generally have masters money and treat you well, in stark 

contrast to a few others I have attended.

Hobbies: Play tournament chess now and then. Rated about 1800.

Read a fair amount, esp. science.

Like to hear oral arguments at the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.
