								<ul>
									<li><font face="Verdana">All USATF clubs are covered under USATF practice insurance when they renew their annual USATF club membership and submit the appropriate applications and fees.</font>
									<li><font face="Verdana">The insurance application is in addition to the USATF club application.</font>
									<li><font face="Verdana">When the insurance application is submitted it must identify the location where practice is held.</font>
									<li><font face="Verdana">One insurance application and associated fee is required for each practice location.</font>
									<li><font face="Verdana">Only USATF athletes who are members of the insured club will be covered by USATF insurance.</font>
									<li><font face="Verdana">An unattached athlete, regardless of membership in USATF, is not covered while attending practice at the same location an insured club is practicing.</font>
									<li><font face="Verdana">If a club wants to invite or permit an unattached athlete to practice a few times (tryout 1-3 times maximum) the unattached athlete is covered vicariously for those few times. &nbsp;During this tryout, the athlete must be a current USATF member and should bring proof of membership before attending. &nbsp;Beyond that, a decision needs to be made to join and no more tryouts allowed for the remaining year. &nbsp;Coverage cannot extend indefinitely.</font>
									<li><font face="Verdana">Each club should set their own policy for &quot;Tryouts&quot; for unattached USATF member athletes.</font>
									<li><font face="Verdana">Tryouts are at the risk of the insured club.</font>
