<h2>Pacific Association LDR 2003<br>Athlete Travel Opportunities</h2>

The PA/USATF Athlete Travel Assistance Program assists qualified athletes
by offering developmental funding to travel to national championship
events. Listed below are the travel opportunities for 2003 offered by the
PA/USATF Long Distance Running Committee.

Contact information for your LDR Committee Chairs:
Tyler Abbott, men, tabbott@gguol.ggu.edu

Michell Hannaford, XC, mhannaford@shastacollege.edu
Hollis Lenderking, ultra, 650/327-1017; fax: 650/325-4775

Athletes in disciplines other than long distance running should contact the
chairs of their respective sport committees, or check the Association's web
site at www.pausatf.org for athlete travel information.

Applicants' best race times should fall within the USATF AADP Funding Time
Guidelines for the relevant distance (shown in chart below).

2003 Road Travel Funds
 
<u>Female</u>  
The female winner of the Jamba Juice 5K on Sunday 9/21/03 will be sent
to the Tufts 10K National Championship in Boston on Monday, October 13. If
the winner is unable to go, the runner selected will be the highest
placing runner who is able to go, subject to the conditions below. 
 
The selected runner must be a US citizen under age 40. She should have run
below 38:30 in the last year, and should never have broken 35:00 (or
similar times at other distances. See chart below). 
 
The selected runner will receive race entry and Saturday-Sunday free
shared housing. I'm told the hotel is but a $5.00 subway ride from the
airport, and within walking distance of the race start/finish. She will
also receive $250 from the Pacific Association towards her travel expense
(as a reimbursement after receipts are submitted to the Pacific
Association office) and $150 from USATF AADP (Association Athlete
Development Program).
 
<u>Male</u> 
The male winner of the Heritage Oaks Bank 10K on Sunday 9/28/03 will be
sent to the Food World Senior Bowl Charity Run 10K National Championship
in Mobile, Alabama November 8. If the winner is unable to go, the runner
selected will be the highest placing runner who is able to go, subject to
the conditions below. 
 
The selected runner must be a US citizen under age 40. He should have run
below 31:30 in the last year, and should never have broken 28:30 (or
similar times at other distances. See chart below). 
 
The selected runner will receive race entry, one night free shared
housing, and transportation to/from the race. He will also receive $250
from the Pacific Association towards his travel expense (as a
reimbursement after receipts are submitted to the Pacific Association
office) and probably some funding to be determined from USATF AADP
(Association Athlete Development Program).

What is AADP?
The USATF Association Athlete Development Program is a cooperative effort
between USATF's national Women's and Men's Long Distance Running
Committees, the races across the  country that host USATF Championship road
races, and the 57 "local" associations of USATF. AADP provides top-level,
local distance runners an expense-paid opportunity to compete in USATF
National Championship races against the best competition in the U. S.
Local USATF Associations select athletes for the Championship races and pay
a portion of the travel costs. The U.S. Championship events offer
additional travel funding and cover lodging, ground transportation, waived
entry, and meals. Members of the LDR Committees organize and coordinate the
effort.
The National LDR Committees determine the guidelines for the program.
Athletes must be 39 years of age or younger, be U.S. citizens, and have PRs
within a given range-10K PRs, for example, between 39:00 and 35:00 for
women, 31:30 and 28:30 for men.
