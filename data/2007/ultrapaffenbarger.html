		<h2><b>Paffenbarger Dies at 86</b></h2>

			<p>July 8, 2007 Ralph Paffenbarger died quietly in Santa Fe, New Mexico at the age of 86 years old. If this name is unfamiliar to you, here is the story of his significant contribution to ultrarunning history.</p>
			<p>Ralph S. Paffenbarger, Jr., MD, Phd,(October 21, 1922 - July 9, 2007) was a professor at both Stanford University School of Medicine and Harvard University School of Public Health. A nationally known speaker, Dr. Paffenbarger is renowned for his classic study on the improvement in longevity though regular lifetime physical activity, which confirmed prior evidence that more physically active people reduce their risk of heart disease and live longer.</p>
			<p>In 1977 Ralph Paffenbarger (53) and Peter Mattei (54), ran the Tevis Cup Ride when there were only 14 runners. The pair's determination to complete the 100 miles was greater then the 24 hour time allowance and so they continued running to Auburn finally arriving at the finish line in a time of 28:36. The two exhausted men arrived in the midst of the rider &#26;s awards ceremony as the coveted Western States Trail Ride buckles were being presented. An elated Wendell Robie stopped the program when the men arrived and profusely raved about the triumph of these two gentlemen to the point that many riders felt their own admirable accomplishments were over shadowed by Ralph and Peter's feat. It was a remarkable sight indeed.</p>
			<p>In the fall of 1977, the first board of directors was established and we began structuring a separate event called the Western State Endurance Run. Ralph and Peter's performance set a new precedent and based on their 28:36 finishing time, we decided to include a 30 hour limit for slower runners who also wanted to enjoy the adventure of running across the Sierra Nevada Mountains. We have Ralph Paffenbarger and Peter Mattei to thank for creating that opportunity and that is the origin of the bronze buckle at WS100.</p>
			<p>Peter Mattei passed away about ten years ago.</p>
