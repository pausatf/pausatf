<p><b>PACIFIC ASSOCIATION JUNIOR OLYMPIC TRACK AND FIELD CHAMPIONSHIPS</b></p>
<p><b>Three-Day Event is First Stop on Track to USATF Junior Olympic Nationals</b></p>
<p>FOLSOM, Calif. - June 19, 2007 - About 1,500 young track and field athletes are expected to compete at the Pacific Association/USA Track &amp; Field Junior Olympic Track &amp; Field Championships, Friday through Sunday, June 22-24 at Granada High School in Livermore, Calif. The youngsters will represent over 60 PA/USATF track clubs from all over Northern California and northwest Nevada.</p>
<p>This weekend's competition is a primary qualifying opportunity for young athletes who wish to advance through a series of progressive events to the USATF National Junior Olympic Track &amp; Field Championships (July 24-29, Walnut, Calif.). At this weekend's association-level meet, the top eight athletes in each track and field event will advance to the USATF Region 14 Junior Olympic Championships (June 29-July 1, Fresno, Calif.). The top three in each event at the regional meet will advance to nationals.</p>
<p>&quot;More athletes will compete in this year's Pacific Association Junior Olympic meet probably than ever before,&quot; said Meet Director Joanne Slaton-Camargo, who also serves as Chair of&nbsp; PA/USATF's Youth Committee. &quot;Entries are up because more clubs and athletes have their eyes on nationals which are close to home in Southern California. We expect a higher level of competition than we've ever had.&quot;</p>
<p>Youth athletes comprise almost 3,000 (55 percent) of PA/USATF's approximately 5,500 members, which is the largest youth member base among USATF's 57 geographic associations throughout the U.S.</p>
<p>Dating back to the mid-1960's, the USATF Junior Olympic program is the most visible youth athlete developmental program in the world. Nearly 70,000 youth athletes compete each year in Junior Olympic Track &amp; Field and Cross Country programs. Many of America's Olympians began as youth athletes, including stars such as Maurice Greene, Allyson Felix, Bryan Clay, John Godina, Deena Kastor, and Allen Johnson. Competition takes place in two-year age divisions, from 10 and under through 17-18.</p>
<p>At last year's PA/USATF Junior Olympic championship, the Oakland-based 3M Track Club emerged as the combined (all age divisions) champion. 3M will attempt to defend its title with a squad that is invigorated by recent strong performances from club members Armand Shyne and Sasha Wallace. Several weeks ago, Shyne, age 8, set a U.S. national record for the turbo javelin (135 feet 0.5 inches) in the Bantam Boys (ages 10 and under) division. This season, Wallace, 11,&nbsp; set a new PA/USATF championship record at 400 meters for Midget Girls (ages 11 and 12). Wallace's record time is 58.30 seconds.</p>
<p>Other clubs expected to contend for the combined team title include Mission Valley Track and Field (based in Union City), Umoja Track Club (Santa Clara), and AC Track Club (Oakland).</p>
<p>The Pacific Association is the largest member association of USA Track &amp; Field (USATF). We serve northern California and northwestern Nevada. USATF is the National Governing Body for track and field, long distance running, and race walking in the United States.
