</font></b></p>
		<p>RENO, Nev. - July 22, 2007 - Two new U.S. outdoor track and field race walking records were set today at the 8th Annual Silver State 3,000 Meter All-Comers Race Walk in Reno, Nev. The event was conducted on the track at Reno High School. </p>
		<p>Jack Bray (Greenbrae, Calif.), age 74, set a pending U..S record of 17 minutes, 34.7 seconds for age 70 to 74 year-old men in the 3,000-meter race walk. Bray's mark bettered the previous U.S. M70-74 record of 17:59.80 set by Donald Gladding in 1994. Bray is a longtime Pacific Association/USA Track &amp; Field race walking standout. He also holds the current U.S. M65-69 and M70-74 5,000-meter race walk records. </p>
		<p>Norm Frable (Ivins, Utah), 61, set a new U.S. standard of 15:51.8 for age 60 to 64 men, which is faster than the current U.S. M60-64 record of 15:56.2 set by 1968 U.S. Olympian Dave Romansky. Both records are pending until they are validated by USA Track &amp; Field. </p>
		<p>Bray also took the first place prize of $1,000 awarded in age-graded scoring by turning in an age-graded score of 88.10 percent. Mark Green (Reno, Nev.), 51, finished in 13:52.1 (87.61 percent age graded), earning the $500 second place age-grade prize. Green was also the overall winner in the men's race. Ted Moore (Reno, Nev.), 68, earned the $250 third place age-grade prize for his 17:00.5 (84.50 percent age graded) finish. Seven finishers earned outstanding age-graded scores of 80% or better, which signifies top national class performances. </p>
		<p>Kelly Wong (San Jose, Calif.), 31, was the overall women's winner, finishing in 15:34.1. </p>
		<p>The event served as the fifth event of 7 races on the 2007 Pacific Association/USATF Race Walking Grand Prix. For full results, visit www.pausatf.org. </p>
