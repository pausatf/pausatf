<b>INDIANAPOLIS</b> - Jordan Hasay has been named USA Track & Field's Athlete
of the Week after winning the 2007 Mt. SAC Cross Country Invitational
Saturday at Mt. San Antonio College in Walnut, Calif.

The 2007 World Youth 1,500m silver medalist, Hasay won the girls
individual 3 mile sweepstakes race at the Mt. SAC Invitational in 16
minutes 42 seconds. She won for the third straight year in a personal
best time and now has sole possession of the fourth-fastest time ever
by a girl at the course.

Now in its sixth year, USATF's Athlete of the Week program is designed
to recognize outstanding performers at all levels of the sport. USATF
names a new honoree each week and features the athlete on the USATF
website. Selections are based on top performances and results from the
previous week.
