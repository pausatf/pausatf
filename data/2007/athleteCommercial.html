						    USATF Director of Communications<br>
						    <a href="link:Jill.Geer@usatf.org">Jill.Geer@usatf.org</a></p>
						  <p>A casting agent we have worked with in the past is looking for athletes<br>
						    for a Canon commercial which will shoot in Japan in late January. </p>
						  <p>They are looking for one long jumper (male or female), 1 high jumper<br>
						    (male or female) and 2-5 MALE 100m sprinters. </p>
						  <p>To be considered for the commercial, the athlete needs to send in video<br>
						    footage from the last six months, and they need to NOT be a contender to<br>
						    make the Olympic Team. They need somebody who will sign a form saying<br>
						    they will NOT be in competing in Beijing at the Olympics. Also the<br>
						    athlete can't be required to wear sponsored or club apparel during the<br>
						    shoot. </p>
						  <p>No NCAA-eligible athletes (this includes High School students who plan<br>
						    to compete in college).</p>
						  <p>Below is all the information, include pay rates, requirements, etc. If<br>
						    you have somebody you think might be a good fit, please send an e-mail<br>
						    to Jill.Geer@usatf.org  and she will put you in touch with the agent.</p>
