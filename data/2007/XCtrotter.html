	ZAP Fitness and Boston Athletic Association to defend team
titles at USATF National Club Cross Country Championships 

INDIANAPOLIS - The men's team from ZAP Fitness and the Boston Athletic
Association's (B.A.A.) women will meet America's top post-collegiate
club teams to defend their 2006 titles as they converge upon Voice of
America Park in West Chester, Ohio on Saturday, December 8, for the
ninth annual USATF National Club Cross Country Championships.

The USATF National Club Cross Country Championships features the top
clubs from across the United States vying for top honors and bragging
rights as the nation's top cross country team. Close to 1,100
competitors are expected at the event, which features a 10-kilometer
men's race and a 6-kilometer women's race. Clubs will compete for a
total prize purse of $25,000, with $20,000 going to the top open teams.

ZAP returns four of its five runners from the 2006 national championship
squad, led by Thomas Morgan, who finished second in last year's race.
Also returning are Joe Driscoll, ninth in 2006, who set his marathon
personal best of 2:18:22 at last month's US Olympic Team Trials-Men's
Marathon in New York; Brendan O'Keefe, 17th in 2006; and, Ryan
Warrenburg, 18th in 2006. The defending champions add Christopher
Pfafenroth and Jonathan Pierce to their 2007 team.

Other teams to watch are last year's second place squad, Team XO, along
with the Asics Aggies and Wisconsin Runner RT.

Payton Batliner and Ben Rosario, who were sixth and seventh respectively
last year; recent Team USA harrier squad members Patrick Gildea, Zach

Donovan (39th) and Mary Proulx (59th). They'll be bolstered with Mariko
Holbrook, Lara Johnson, Nicole Plante, and Stephanie Wescott in their
efforts to win the national title.

Last year's runner-ups Wisconsin Runner Racing Team and 2005 champs See
Jane Run aim to dethrone the B.A.A., along with a strong Run Ohio squad
led by 2007 World Championships marathoner Ann Alyanak, who is a strong
contender for the individual title. Team Indiana Elite also looks for a
spot on the podium.

include 2007 NACAC steeplechase champion Kristin Anderson; Wisconsin
Runner's Bethany Brewster; ZAP Fitness' Caroline Cretti; former NCAA 10
km champion Leigh Daniel of Run Ohio; former Columbia University

Kenya; former Indiana University All-American Jessica Gall; North

All-American Serena Ramsey; Maria Magdalena Sandoval, who was fifth in
this meet in 2004;and, Peninsula Distance Club's Kathleen Trotter, the
former Stanford standout and 2004 Team USA junior squad member. Jill

another notable entry in this race.

squads will also do battle on the Voice of America Park turf for age
division championship titles over 10 km, while the women race over 6 km.

Team, looks to defend his national title. Former national masters 10 km
champion Peter Magill of South Pasadena, Calif., who runs for the Fluffy
Bunny Track Club seeks to wrest the championship from Lokken

Bill Iffrig of Everett, Wash., and the Snohomish Track Club will defend
his national title in the men's 70-74 division.

New York) returns to defend her title in the women's 55-59 category, as
will 2006 champion in the women's 60-64 category Janet Bowman of Corte
Madera, Calif.
