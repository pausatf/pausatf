<font face=times color=black size=3>Although Tom Moore wasn't originally from Modesto, many credit him with putting the Central Valley town on the map in terms of track and field.<p>
After attending Petaluma High School and the University of California, Moore moved to Ceres in 1940 to work for his father's lumber yard.<p>
Under the tutelage of Brutus Hamilton, Moore set a world record in the 120-high hurdles in 1935 with a time of 14.2 seconds.<p>
By the 1940s, he had semi-retired from racing, but was making a name for himself as a race starter in all but the 120-high hurdles, which he was still running.<p>Even after he gave up the hurdles, he continued to be one of the best-known race starters, serving in that role for more than six decades.<p>
Back then, starters were jacks of all trades. So Moore not only shot the starting gun, he helped adjust lights and do other things to make the MJC Track more inviting to the athletes.<p>
By 1945, Moore had taken on the responsibility of meet director for the Modesto Relays&#151;a position he held for 60 years. During the 1950s, 13 world records were either tied or set at the Modesto event.<p>
And the event&#151;the third-longest running meet in the nation and the ninth longest in the world&#151;continues to be one of the top draws for U.S. track and field stars, partly because of its reputation for world records.<p>
Among the more notable athletes who have participated in the Modesto Relays are sprinter Florence Griffith-Joyner, pole vaulter Stacy Dragila, miler Jim Ryan, sprinter Maurice Greene, heptathlete Jackie Joyner-Kersee, hurdler Edwin Moses and longjumper Bob Beamon.<p>
He also was one of the first race directors to invite women to compete at the same meet with men, and he also included Special Olympic athletes as part of the Modesto Relays.

<p>In 1988, Moore was inducted into the National Track & Field Hall of Fame.<p>
Moore died on May 10, 2002, at the age of 88, but his legacy continues.<p>
We, the Central Valley Roadrunners, would like to dedicate this meet to Tom Moore&#151;the man who was the epitome of community track and field for all ages, who put Modesto on the track and field map, and who favored good sportsmanship and fair competition above all else.
