  YOUTH COMMITTEE MEETING
  <br />
  Youth Clubs</h2>
  <p>November 26, 2007
  <p>Hello everyone and welcome to the Pacific Association USATF's 2008 track and field season. Our next Youth Club Meeting is scheduled for Saturday, December 15th at the Emeryville Recreation Center. We will go over highlights from our Asilomar Conference Grounds retreat. One of the outcomes from that retreat was to have a series of two more youth committee meetings before the commencement of our 2008 season. The next one is scheduled for February 9, 2008 at James Logan High School in Union City.
  <br />
  <br />
  Starting in 2008, every youth team will be presented with a binder with resource material focusing on answering most of the frequently asked questions. We expect that if you have any questions that you will first refer to the binder. We will have those binders available at this meeting. There will be two sessions offered to come and pick up your binder and discuss anything else you may want to know regarding your youth committee.
  <p>2007 was the kickoff year for the background checks requiring actual live scan fingerprinting. Please let us know if you have new coaches or volunteers who need to be fingerprinted. We must have a minimum of twenty individuals before we can have a technician come to our meeting on December 15th to do the live scan for us. Please RSVP to George Paddeck at <a href="mailto:ghpadd@yahoo.com">ghpadd@yahoo.com</a> if you need these services. We will keep track of the number of people who contact him and let you know if live scan service will be available. If so, we will have live scan service from 1 - 3 p.m.
  <p>For your convenience we will have team registration information available. Please remember to renew your team registration before May 1, 2008 to avoid the $100.00 late registration fee. Instead of the usual $75.00 renewal fee, you will be assessed $175.00.
