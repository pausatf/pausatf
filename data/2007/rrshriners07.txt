RECAP
Hours after Adam Goucher and Kara Goucher both qualified for the U.S. 
World Championships team at the AT&T USA Outdoor Track & Field 
Championships, an Oakland, Calif. based couple demonstrated that the 
Gouchers aren't the only fast husband/wife distance running team in the 
U.S.

Richie Boulet and Magdalena Lewy-Boulet also share some swift talent. 
Richie Boulet 34, registered his second victory at this PA/USATF 8K road 
championship (he also won in 2005) while Magdalena Lewy-Boulet, 33, 
easily won the women's race.
     
A dawdling 5-minute-per-mile pace among an early pack of lead men played 
right into the legs of Boulet, a former All-American at Cal-Berkeley and 
sub-four-minute miler. Boulet broke the men's race open midway and 
cruised to a 24:36 victory over his Transports adidas teammates James 
Nielsen (2nd, 24:45) and Andrew Hill (3rd, 24:58).

Meanwhile, Lewy-Boulet led the women from starting gun to finish tape. 
The U.S. marathon standout's 26:53 winning time easily set a new women's 
race record. Allison Kerr was runner-up (28:37). 45-year-old Rosemarie 
Lagunas (28:43) ran a superb race, finishing third overall and winning 
the female masters title.

Among male masters, Jeff Adkins, 46,  (26:29) and Jose Aispuro, 45, 
(26:33) waged a close contest, placing 1-2 in the over-40 (years old) age 
division.

The event was staged at the Shriners Hospital, Sacramento. For full
