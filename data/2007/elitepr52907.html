							<p>Palo Alto, CA&#x2026;&#x2026;The Northern California Olympians (NCO), a chapter of the USOC Alumni Organization, announced today the establishment of a grant program to provide direct financial assistance to athletes with successful competitive records who have the potential to qualify for future Olympic or Paralympic Teams.</p>

							<p>Jim Schmitz, chair of the NCO Grant Program and Olympian (weightlifting &#150; 1980, 88 &amp; 92)), explains, &ldquo;This is the fourth time the NCO has awarded grants &#150; and it is always exciting to help provide funding for Olympians and Paralympians from Northern California - to be able to help future Olympians and Paralympians from our hometowns.&rdquo;</p>
							<p>Information about the grant program will be sent via email to all Olympic Sports National Governing Bodies (NGB) and to members of the Northern California Olympians.&nbsp; This year, the Northern California Olympians will award ten grants of $500 - $1000 each.&nbsp; The deadline for applications is June 30, 2007.&nbsp;&nbsp; Applications will be reviewed by the Northern California Olympians&rsquo; Board of Directors and the grants will be announced on August 8, 2007 &#150; exactly one year from the Opening Ceremonies for the 2008 Olympic Games.&nbsp; Grant applications are available at <a href="http://www.ncolympians.org">www.ncolympians.org</a> or by calling 650.856.3200.</p>
							<p>Funds for the NCO Travel and Training Grant Program come from the proceeds of the NCO Welcome Home Dinner, held every four years, just after the Olympic and Paralympic Games, from contributions from Olympians from past teams and community members.</p>
