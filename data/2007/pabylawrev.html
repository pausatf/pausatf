		<center><h2>Pacific Association/USATF<br>
			ARTICLE 19 PROPOSED BYLAW REVISION</h2></center>
		<p>   This is the bylaw change that was proposed and approved in concept at the January 30th, 2007 Board of 
		Athletics meeting in Sacramento. This article entails the requirements for suspension and or removal of a 
		member of the Pacific Association. There may be some duplication with Article 16 but not much. It somewhat 
		parallels Article 18 which is for the suspension of an officer. No other articles were changed except for 
		references and the renumbering of subsequent articles.<br>
			<br>
			<b>It is needed due to the risks involved in implementation of the Pacific Association's background check program. The PA's background check is for Coaches and volunteers who routinely work with children under 18 years of age during practices, transporting them to and from meets as well as those officials who work Pacific Association youth meets. It is an attempt to clearly specify planned action if an individual fails to pass our background check, since ours is involves the use of different agencies although the same offenses that are being use by the National USATF program for most other associations. The next <a href="data/meetings.html">Pacific Association Board Meeting</a> is March 20, 2007 in Foster City and the final version of this bylaw change will be voted on at that time.</b><br>

ARTICLE 19. SUSPENSION OR REMOVAL OF A MEMBER<br>
			<b>(a)</b> Any member or member organization of this Association may be suspended for good cause from the Pacific Association immediately upon confirmation of the cause which is stated in a request for a &quot;Notice of Suspended for Cause&quot; by any member. The cause may be for any of the following reasons or upon receipt and verification of a notice of an indictment for a felony involving one of these items:<br>
<li>1) any crimes against children or<br>
<li>2) any sexual offenses or<br>
<li>3) drugs  (within 5 years) or <br>
<li>4) weapons violations or<br>
<li>5) assaults, battery or any other crime of violence or<br>
<li>6) lewd conduct or<br>
<li>7) failure to pass a properly conducted background check or<br>
<li>8) the filing of a grievance for conduct detrimental to the sport of Athletics against the individual or the organization, such as items 2,4, 5,7,8 in Article 18(b).<br>
<li>9) divulgement of information concerning the reason for a background check failure to individuals not privy to that information by law. <br>
			<br>
			
No hearing or review is necessary before this notice can be sent to the individual involved.<br>
				<br>
				<b>(b)</b> Any member or member organization of this Association may be removed for good cause from the Pacific Association by the issuance of &quot;Notice of Removal for Cause&quot; letter to said member for conviction of a felony involving:<br>
<li>1) any crimes against children or<br>
<li>2) any sexual offenses or<br>
<li>3) drugs (within 5 years) or <br>
<li>4) weapons violations or<br>
<li>5) assaults, battery or any other crime of violence or<br>
<li>6) lewd conduct or<br>
<li>7) the acceptance by the Board of Athletics of a recommendation to &quot;Remove for Cause&quot; from either <b>i)</b> a Grievance/Hearing Panel conducted under Article 16, or this article as it applies, or<b> ii)</b> the Background Program Director because of a finding of conduct detrimental to the sport of Athletics. (<b>Note:</b> the Board of Directors can and will act for the Board of Athletics to accept such recommendation so that the notice can be sent if there is more than one month interval before the next Board of Athletics meeting. The Board of Directors will notify and get approval for such action at the next Board of Athletics meeting. A notice and vote by email by either board to accept the recommendation is an acceptable practice.)<br>
				<br>
				
Such a letter would not be issued if the recommendation of the hearing panel, because of extenuating circumstances, was limited to suspension of membership for specific period of time, assume no further problems.  Rather a new letter of a "Notice to Suspend for Cause" would be sent specifying the length of time for the suspension of that individual or organization and what action might need to be taken for that person or organization to be reinstated. <br>
				<br>
				
 Subsequently the national governing body will be informed of what ever action was taken.  If it was to remove the individual or organization from membership in the Pacific Association the cover letter would request that they likewise suspend or remove the individual or organization from general membership in national body or any other association.<br>
				<br>
				<b>(c)</b> If an individual fails a background check by the California Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation or the background check system being use by USATF nationally 1), they will receive a letter from the Pacific Association with the Notice of Suspension and action they must take to be reinstated. It will include:<br>
<li>1) the deadline by which time they must explain in writing why the suspension should not be made final and a "Notice of Removal" issued, <br>
<li>2) how they can get a copy of the reason for the background failure from the reporting agency since California law does not allow the Pacific Association to report that information to anyone including the individual involved.   <br>
<li>3) notification that they can request to have a special closed hearing with three non involved individuals (not involved with the individual or member of the same committee) and the date by which such request must be made, namely, one month following the mailing or emailing of the explanation requested in item 1 above to explain the problem that lead to their suspension.  <br>
				<br>
				<b>(d)</b> Once the &quot;Notice of Suspension&quot; letter has been answered then a hearing panel can be empanelled if a hearing is requested. It will follow the guidelines put forward in Article 16. In the hearing the suspended individual must try to convince the hearing panel that the conduct for which the suspension was invoked should not be a reason for suspension or removal of his or her membership in the Pacific Association. This will occur as soon as possible following the request but only after the condition in item 1 is met. The hearing timing will depend on time required for the clearance of the panel members so that they can see the background information from the state or federal agencies. This is because California law does not allow anyone but background program director to see the background check information until they are cleared. When a hearing is requested the President or his/her designee will select the proposed panel members and then these individuals can be submitted for clearance by the Department of Justice so they can see the appropriate sensitive material. Note that this clearance is NOT mandatory if we get sufficient information disclosed in explanation from the individual or organization that has been suspended. It simplifies the procedure if the put the burden of proof is on the individual to show us their record and why they should not be suspended. One member of each panel shall be an athlete who is at least 18 years old.<br>
				<br>
				<b>(e)</b> If a panel is not requested then the background program director will make the initial determination if the individual's explanation is adequate or not and therefore whether to issue a recommendation to the Board of Athletics for<br>
<li>1) the continuance of the suspension for a time to be sided by the Board of Athletics<br>
<li>2) the termination of the suspension because the issue does not require such action  or<br>
<li>3) the issuance of "Notice to Remove for Cause" letter and notification of the National Office of our action.<br>
				<br>
				<b>(f) </b>Failure to act by the deadline or failure to answer the &quot;Notice of Suspension&quot; letter will result in the immediate issuance of &quot;Notice to Remove for Cause&quot; letter without any formal hearing.<br>
			<li><br>
				<b>(g) </b>The Hearing Panel will make a recommendation to the Board of Athletics who will decide to make the suspension for a specific timeframe or permanent with instructions to issue a &quot;Notice to Remove for Cause&quot;. If a &quot;Notice to Remove for Cause&quot; is issued, USATF will be informed of our action with a recommendation that they also remove the individual or organization. Note: Suspension and /or Remove by the Pacific Association may always be appealed to the National Governing Body.<br>
