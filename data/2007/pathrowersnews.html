				<h2>Olympic hopefuls among us - Local ladies in training work towards Beijing in ‘08</h2>
				<div class="story" align ="left">
					<h4>By Gwen Stevenson (Courtesy of the Galt Herald)</h4>
					<p>The next summer Olympic games are in Beijing, China. When you tune in to the track and field portion, you might see some familiar young ladies from our town. 
					Living and working locally, while training hard every day are Stephanie Trafton and Rachel Longfors, two Olympic hopefuls for 2008. 
					</p>
					<h4>Stephanie Trafton</h4>
					<p>Stephanie (Brown) Trafton, 27, grew up in Oceana, Calif., a small town near Pismo Beach. Stressing the importance of not doing just one sport in high school, she was a well-rounded athlete during her high school years at Arroyo Grande High, participating in varsity basketball, volleyball, and track and field. 
					</p>
					<p>“Instead of specializing in high school, kids should participate in many sports,” said Trafton. “It develops general athleticism.” 
					</p>
					
					<p>But Trafton did end up finding her specialty when she was the California champion in discus and shot put in 1998, the year she graduated. She was the No. 2 discus thrower nationally during her senior year of high school with the sixth best national record. She still holds the California State Meet record. 
					</p>
					
					<p>She continued on to a successful career at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo where she attained a B.S. degree in industrial engineering. Trafton was named a six-time All-American honor at Cal Poly, which put her in the top eight Americans in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) standings. 
					</p>
					
					<p>At the 2004 Olympic trials held at Sacramento State, her throw of 61.9 meters (a little more than 203 feet) exceeded her previous personal best by nine feet, giving her a second place finish, qualifying her to represent the U.S.A. in the Olympics. 
					“I had a phenomenal personal record at the trials,” said Trafton, “the best in my life.” 
					So, on she traveled to Greece in September 2004. There, she made it to the semi-finals, placing 11th in her group. It was since watching the Olympics at four years old that she knew she wanted to go for that goal. 
					</p>
					
					<p>“The Olympics was a realization of my childhood dreams to wear a Team USA uniform and represent the United States in competition.” Trafton said. “I knew I wanted to be an Olympian. My father bought me a Mary-Lou Retton stars and stripes gymnastics outfit. It was my favorite outfit to wear.” 
					</p>
					
					<p>The following spring, she married her husband Jerry in March 2005 and moved to Galt and continued her non-stop schedule. She is employed by Sycamore Environmental Consultants as a draftsperson, also working with project management software and environmental planning. 
					</p>
					
					<p>“My job is flexible enough to allow me to train,” said Trafton, “and I have an extremely supportive husband, and that really helps a lot.” 
					</p>
					
					<p>Flexible is what she has to be to endure the grueling schedule. On three workdays per week, she will go to work, then leave work for about three and a half hours go to Rancho Cordova to train at a sports performance center. Then she goes back to finish her work day. Tony Mikla is her trainer at Results Physical Therapy and Training Center. 
					</p>
					
					<p>“Training for the Olympics requires more than workouts and practice, it is a lifestyle commitment for more than a decade, and Stephanie is the epitome of that commitment,” said Mikla. “Stephanie exemplifies the balance of power and grace, which will take her to the Olympic trials in Eugene.” 
					</p>
					
					<p>On two other days of the week, Trafton does a double workout; the first one at their home gym, then in the afternoon, goes to the training center along with Longfors in Isleton for the rest of the day. 
					</p>
					
					<p>The 10-acre training center is located on Twitchell Island, on a patch of land bound by Three Mile Slough and the San Joaquin River, right in the middle of nowhere. 
					</p>
					
					<p>Tiger Bar Ranch, as it is named, was built by real estate developer Tony Rosenthal of Brentwood, specifically to give Olympic athletes a place to train. A least a dozen elite and national class athletes, some two and three-time Olympians, in mostly track and field are able to use this unusual training center. 
					</p>
					
					<p>Some of the notables that Trafton and Longfors share training space with are two-time Olympian Suzy Powell-Roos (who still holds the American discus record and No. 2 in the world); three-time Olympian Amy Acuff; pole vaulters Tommy Skipper and Tye Harvey, just to name a few. 
					</p>
					
					<p>Dan Pfaff, who Trafton says is “knowledgeable, kind and generous,” is the resident coach who knew Longfors at the University of Florida. Pfaff is able to give a lot of personal attention to the athletes. 
					</p>
					
					<p>“I came to Tiger Bar via (Olympians) Amy Acuff and Suzy Powell, who recruited me out west from my Florida position,” said Pfaff. 
					</p>
					
					<p>One of Trafton’s friends from church works for local company Utility Vault, which is making and donating cement discus rings for the training center in Isleton that they will be able to use for practice. 
					</p>
					
					<p>“A discus ring is the cement pad that we stand on when we toss the discus. It is a circle just over eight feet in diameter,” Trafton said. “It is a pretty generous offer and the rings will be utilized by many athletes training for the 2008 Olympic team. 
					Trafton says that 2004 was a pivotal year for her, physically and spiritually. 
					</p>
					
					<p>“I had rededicated my life to God; Jerry and I got baptized,” said Trafton. “It was a revolutionary year. I realized that being in this sport is not about taking something, it’s about giving all I can give. It’s about looking inward for my strength.” 
					Trafton finds enjoyment in her sport because it allows her an opportunity to push the limits of her physical abilities as well as pursue a healthy lifestyle. 
					</p>
					
					<p>“As a bonus for my success as a track and field athlete, I am able to travel around the country and world, experience different cultures, and reach out to other athletes that need encouragement and an uplifting word,” said Trafton. 
					</p>
					
					<p>She discovered why she was doing track and field, and learned to balance her physical and spiritual self as well as her relationships with people and family. 
					</p>
					
					<p>“I am there to glorify God,” said Trafton. “Being able to train is such a gift.” 
					</p>
					
					<h4>Rachel Longfors</h4>
					<p>Growing up in Erhard, Minn., Rachel Longfors was multi-sport athlete, playing volleyball, basketball, cross country, and track and field in high school, becoming a four-year letter earner in track and basketball and captain of both in 2001 at Pelican Rapids High. She was also a state discus champion in 2001, all-state as well as all-star and even MVP basketball player during her senior year. 
					</p>
					
					<p>She then went on to the University of Florida where she attained majors in health science and anthropology and a minor in education. 
					</p>
					
					<p>By her senior year she had full scholarships for her involvement in track and field, and as Trafton, was also partially funded by the High Performance Division of USA Track and Field. Dan Pfaff was the coaching in Florida at that time. 
					</p>
					
					<p>“I met Rachel at the University of Florida where I was an assistant men’s coach. The women’s throws coach was let go with six weeks to go in the season,” said Pfaff. “I agreed to help the women who were stranded; we hit it off and Rachel was second at NCAA’s that year,” “Both Rachel and Stephanie are extremely dedicated, excellent time managers, and very intelligent in life and sport.” 
					</p>
					
					<p>Among many other personal records including NCAA champion winnings, Lonfors also has a six-time All American title by her name. Representing Florida, her personal best discus throw was at the Olympic trials in 2004, where she made the first round cut. 
					“The top 24 in the nation make it into the Olympic trials, and the top 12 of those make the finals.” said Longfors. “Out of the 12, the top three go to the Olympics; I was sixth out of that 12.” 
					</p>
					
					<p>Spending time at meets at the Chula Vista Olympic Training Center in San Diego, Rachel and Stephanie met at a track meet, and then continued to compete against each other, and then train together when they could. 
					</p>
					
					<p>“I was finishing my degrees and trying to compete on my own,” said Longfors. 
					With the need for a training partner, Trafton luring her this way and the draw of a past coach now out west, Lonfors moved to Galt. 
					</p>
					
					<p>“Stephanie invited me to move out here to live with them,” said Longfors. 
					Longfors now trains together with Trafton, and is also working towards 2008 Olympic Trials which will be held this next summer in Eugene, Ore. 
					</p>
					
					<p>She has the advantage of the expertise from Coach Pfaff who is now at Tiger Bar Training Center. She also works at Fitness Pro Gym in Galt, and when she’s not training, does some volunteer office work and assisting in teaching the kids at her church. 
					</p>
					
					<p>In her free time she enjoys going to the coffee house, and has been doing a lot of reading, especially on missions. She has a heart for missionary work and dreams of going to a third world country someday. 
					</p>
					
					<p>All of this change has caused Longfors to have a spiritual awakening, since she had become a Christian at a young age. 
					</p>
					
					<p>“I’m learning a lot about grace,” said Longfors. “I’m starting to really understand my faith, learning a lot about God and the truth in God’s Word.” 
					She recently finished reading the inspirational book Daughters of Hope by Kay Marshall Strom and Michele Rickett. 
					</p>
					
					<p>“I have come to a new understanding of why athletics is such a huge platform to advance the body of Christ,” said Longfors. “Through foreign competitions and the Olympics, athletes are exposed to other athletes from all over the world.” 
					</p>
					
					<p>Exposed to athletes from closed countries or countries where believers of Christ are persecuted, Longfors looks for opportunities, “To reach out to others or to be an encourager for the people of that nation.” 
					</p>
					
					<p>Longfors is thankful for the gift of being able to train, saying that doing her sport ‘the highest form of worship’ to God. Being away from her family and missing her friends, even though quite busy, Longfors is having to learn about accepting help from others and living in faith. 
					</p>
					
					<p>“I’m learning to depend on God for what comes next,” said Longfors. “God has always provided; I’m taking it day by day.” 
					</p>
					
					<p>Not only is the training a challenge, but so is the financial end of it all. Both Trafton and Longfors need to come up with at least $10,000 in grants annually to fund their endeavors. Trafton’s sponsors are Moreno Trenching Co., Sycamore Environmental Consultants, USATF and PAUSATF. Longfors is being sponsored so far by Chateau Turner’s State Farm Insurance in Galt. 
					</p>
