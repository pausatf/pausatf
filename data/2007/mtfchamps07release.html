								OLDER ATHLETES SHOWCASED AT PACIFIC ASSOCIATION MASTERS TRACK AND FIELD CHAMPIONSHIPS <br>
								<br>
								<br>
								SAN MATEO, Calif. - June 30, 2007 - Approximately 200 masters athletes (ages 35 and over) competed at the Pacific Association/USA Track &amp; Field Masters Outdoor Track &amp; Field Championships at College of San Mateo on June 30. On a sunny day, air conditioned by the San Francisco Bay Area's natural breezes, CSM's beautiful hilltop track overlooking the bay hosted a full slate of track and field events. Athletes and USATF clubs from throughout California and northwestern Nevada participated.<br>
								<br>
								Among many fine performances, in the men's 100-meter sprint, <b>Aaron Thigpen</b> (Brentwood, Calif.) recorded a win in 10,78 seconds, topping the men's age 40-44 age group. Thigpen is the U.S. 100-meter record holder in this age group. He set the standard of 10.60 earlier this year. Thigpen also won the 200 meter race in 23.26.<br>
								<br>
								 &quot;I've been off for six weeks with Achilles tendon problems, just running on the grass, so I'm happy with today,&quot; Thigpen said. &quot;I'm focusing on the worlds (World Masters Athletics Championships, Italy) in September.&quot;<br>
								<br>
								<b>Liz Palmer</b>, 46, from Folsom, Calif. topped her W45-49 age group in the 100 meters (13.09), 200 meters (28.39), 80 meter hurdles (13.00), and shot put (7.66 meters/25-1.75 feet) while tuning up for the upcoming pentathlon competition at the USA Masters Outdoor Championships (Orono, Maine, August 2-5). Palmer will be seeking her fourth consecutive national age group title in the five-event pentathlon.<br>
								<br>
								&quot;I'm really happy with my performances today,&quot; said Palmer, who competes for the Sacramento-based Golden West Track Club. &quot;I appreciate competition so much more as an older athlete because it's harder. You appreciate your fellow competitors more because you know they're all working hard,&quot;<br>
								<br>
								Former University of California-Berkeley All-American <b>Rod Jett</b> won the M40-44 110 meter hurdles in 14.10 in a masters personal best.<br>
								<br>
								&quot;I haven't had a race in two months so I was a little rusty,&quot; Jett said. &quot;By [USA Masters] nationals I hope to be in better form. I'd like to get the [M44] record [of 13.73 held by David Ashford].&quot;<br>
								<br>
								 In the men's 10,000 meter race, <b>Joshua Rayman</b>, 38, visiting from New York City, won in 35:19.10 and recorded a one second personal best on the track 18 years after he ran his previous PR for Williams College (Mass.). Rayman attended Tamalpais High School in Marin County.<br>
								<br>
								Rayman was just one illustration at this event that advancing age does not necessarily translate to decreased performance in athletics, The oldest male and female competitors in the meet were <b>KK Slaughter</b>, 88, who competed at 100 meters (29.96), and <b>Lynette Lucess</b>, 79, who competed in the 400 meters (1:57.16), 800 meters (4:51.50), and 1,500 meters (10.06.03).<br>
								<br>
								In the companion open competition, <b>Travis Nutter</b>, age 32, of Danville, Calif. won the men's hammer throw in 72.40 meters/237-6 feet after placing fourth at the USA Track &amp; Field Outdoor Championships in Indianapolis the previous week.<br>
								<br>
								&quot;I didn't throw very well at nationals, so I just wanted to get in a good competition and sort out my technical [mechanics],&quot; Nutter said.<br>
								<br>In team competition, the Golden West Track Club won both the men's and women's masters meet titles.<br>
								<br>
								&quot;It was a fantastic day, lots of great competition with many full events, and a really big hammer throw competition,&quot; said Meet Director <b>Joy Upshaw-Margerum</b>.<br>
