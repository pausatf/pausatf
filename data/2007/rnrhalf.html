								SAN JOSE, Calif., (August 7, 2007) - San Jose's Rock 'n' Roll Half<br>
								Marathon will feature two American Olympic hopefuls on Sun., Oct. 14,<br>
								2007 as Olympic silver medalist, Meb Keflezighi, and San Jose native,<br>
								J.T. Service, tune up before the U.S. Olympic Marathon Team Trials to be<br>
								held in New York City on Sat., Nov. 3, 2007.<br>
								<br>
								Keflezighi, 32, winner of the silver medal at the 2004 Athens Olympics in<br>
								the marathon, had to pull out of the 2006 Rock 'n' Roll Half Marathon<br>
								with a leg cramp near mile 11 of the 13.1-mile race. He was staging a<br>
								comeback, picking off runners one by one, as he gained ground on the<br>
								blistering pace set by Duncan Kibet of Kenya, who won in a time of 1<br>
								hour, 22 seconds. Despite an early exit from the race, Keflezighi<br>
								realized the potential the San Jose course offers to runners looking to<br>
								gauge their race speed.<br>
								<br>
								&quot;Last year, I wanted to test my fitness prior to the ING New York City<br>
								Marathon,&quot; said Keflezighi. &quot;The weather was perfect, the course is fast,<br>
								and depending on how I perform over the next couple months, I feel I can<br>
								put together a strong race in San Jose before the Olympic trials.&quot;<br>
								<br>
								Keflezighi, who will celebrate his 20th anniversary as a U.S. citizen<br>
								this October, hopes to make his third U.S. Olympic team. A win for<br>
								Keflezighi at the Olympic trials would represent his first ever victory<br>
								in 10 marathon starts and solidify his spot on the Olympic team provided<br>
								he earns the Olympic &quot;A&quot; standard of 2:15:00 at the trials or prior to<br>
								April 21, 2008.<br>
								<br>
								Keflezighi began running at age 12 and competed with two of his brothers<br>
								at San Diego High School where he won three state titles his senior year.<br>
								At UCLA, running for his current coach Bob Larsen, Keflezighi won four<br>
								NCAA titles while earning a B.A. in communications. He currently lives in<br>
								San Diego and in Mammoth Lakes, Calif. where he trains at altitude with<br>
								Team Running USA.<br>
								<br>
								Service, 26, returns to defend his title as the top San Jose and Bay Area<br>
								finisher at the Rock 'n' Roll Half Marathon, finishing the 2006 inaugural<br>
								race in a time of 1:07:46. However, at the start of this year's race, the<br>
								butterflies will be fluttering a little harder in his stomach as he<br>
								prepares for his first shot at an Olympic team.<br>
								<br>
								&quot;Making it to the Olympic team is any athlete's dream,&quot; Service said. &quot;As<br>
								I look back over the peaks and valleys of my running career, my<br>
								preparation for the trials has seemingly taken a lifetime.  When I found<br>
								the marathon, things seemed to have fall into place. Now, I just want to<br>
								run a fast tune up in San Jose, then give a huge effort at the trials and<br>
								let chips fall where they may. It's all really exciting.&quot;<br>
								<br>
								His father, Tom Service, has been a running role model throughout his<br>
								son's life. As the head coach of both the men's and women's distance<br>
								programs at Santa Clara University, Tom Service has helped guide J.T.<br>
								through his athletic career.<br>
								<br>
								&quot;Although he has never officially been my running coach, he has always<br>
								advised me on a day-to-day basis,&quot; Service said of his father. &quot;Somehow<br>
								he has walked the tight rope of encouraging me to participate in his<br>
								favorite sport while constantly letting me know that he would love me<br>
								just as much if I quit tomorrow.&quot;<br>
								<br>
								As a member of the Asics Aggies Running Club, an Olympic development<br>
								program for USA Track &amp; Field, Service has strengthened his own career in<br>
								his bid for the Olympics.<br>
								<br>
								Service has found success at past Elite Racing musical marathon events.<br>
								In addition to his top regional performance at the Rock 'n Roll Half<br>
								Marathon last year, Service was the top American finisher at the Rock 'n'<br>
								Roll Marathon in San Diego, Calif. in June, 2006, finishing in a time of<br>
								2:24:42. The Rock 'n' Roll Marathon was the first of his career.<br>
								<br>
								When he isn't logging marathon miles through the streets of the South<br>
								Bay, Service is hard at work as a law student at Santa Clara. He also<br>
								will lead Team Swift Justice at the Rock 'n' Roll Half Marathon to raise<br>
								money for a local community law center which advises, counsels and<br>
								represents low-income clients on legal issues involving workers' rights,<br>
								workers' compensation, immigration, and consumer protection. Runners<br>
								interested in running the Rock 'n' Roll Half Marathon with Team Justice<br>
								may call 408-406-6490.<br>
								<br>
								Born and raised in San Jose, Service ran cross country for Archbishop<br>
								Mitty High School. He went on to receive his undergraduate degree from<br>
								the University of California, Santa Barbara where he was a two-time<br>
								all-Big West Conference distance runner.<br>
