				<b>California to Host Final Teva U.S. Mountain Running Team Selection Race</b><br>
				<br>
				Colorado Springs, CO ---- The inaugural Mt. Tam Trophy Race will be held at 8:00 a.m. on Sunday, July 15, in Sausalito, CA. The event is the third and final selection race for the Teva U.S. Mountain Running Team and it is the first time the west coast has hosted a selection race in the twenty-plus year history of the U.S. team competing at the World Mountain Running Trophy Event. &quot;Having a selection race on the West Coast is a great opportunity for some new mountain runners to learn about our program. Chris Lundy, a three-time team member, has done an excellent job getting the permits secured for the event and scouting out a great course,&quot; said Nancy Hobbs, manager of the Teva U.S. Mountain Running Team.<br>
				<br>
				Due to permit restrictions, race entries are limited to the first 60 competitors. There are still spaces in the race with registration available at www.active.com or on race day if space available.<br>
				<br>
				The race start is located one mile east of Stinson Beach, at the intersection of Steep Ravine<br>
				<br>
				and Dipsea trails. The 12 kilometer route boasts an elevation change of 2600 feet and is run entirely on trail, much of which is single track with technical downhills. The first 1/2 mile is rolling, followed by a 1000 foot ascent up Steep Ravine Trail including a short ladder climb at 1.2 miles. Descend 1100 feet into Muir Woods to the three-mile point, climb back out to Cardiac Hill and return down Dipsea Trail to the finish. Accelerade and water provided at the start/finish and at PanToll aid station.<br>
				<br>
				To get to the start line, park legally in Stinson Beach and run up the Dipsea trail. The Trailhead is at intersection of Panoramic and Hwy 1, start line is 1 mile east, visible from Panoramic Hwy. Portable toilets at start pre-race, and restrooms/outdoor showers in Stinson Beach Park post-race.<br>
				<br>
				There will be $500 in prize money with $300 donated by Irene Herman Insurance and Real Estate Services and $200 donated by the American Trail Running Association. The funds will be distributed evenly between the men and women with $150 to first place, $75 to the second place, and $25 to third place. Cutting edge trail shoes and other prizes are provided by La Sportiva, Accelerade, 180s, and Tec Labs. The Teva U.S. Mountain Running Team will compete in the 23rd World Mountain Running Trophy in Saillon, Ovronnaz, Switzerland, on September 15, 2007. This year's Trophy races are up/down events (as opposed to even-numbered years when the events are held on uphill courses) with the senior men running three loops of the 4.050 kilometer course for a distance of just over 12km, the senior women and junior men running two loops of the 4.050 course for a distance slightly over 8km, while the junior women run one loop of the course at 4.050km. Donations to the team are welcome and are used to offset travel expenses to the World Trophy.<br>
				<br>
				The women's team includes four athletes with the top three finishers scoring for the team. Six athletes will represent the men's team with the top four finishers scoring. The junior men's team includes a maximum of four with top three scoring while the junior women's team is a maximum of three with the top two scoring. Team manager Nancy Hobbs, Colorado Springs, CO, team leader Richard Bolt, Portland, Oregon, team manager for the juniors Dave Dunham, Bradford, MA, and women's team manager Ellen Miller, Vail, CO will accompany the team to Switzerland. At the Mt. Tam Trophy Race, the top U.S. male and top U.S. female finisher will receive an automatic team berth. This is the third and final team selection race. The first selection race, the USA Mountain Running Championships, was hosted at Mt. Cranmore on June 24 in North Conway, NH. Rickey Gates, 26, Boulder, CO, Paul Low, 33, Belchertown, MA, and Anita Ortiz, 43, Eagle, CO, received automatic berths on the team. The USA Trail Championships on June 30 in Steamboat Springs, CO served as the second selection race where Simon Gutierrez, 41, Alamosa, CO, and Christine Lundy, 36, Sausalito, CA, received automatic berths.<br>
				<br>
				The remaining members of the open squad, (two males, one female), will be selected by the Mountain Ultra Trail Council with input from the team staff based on results at the selection races, past World Trophy events, national and international racing experience including mountain, road, cross country, and track. Athletes MUST run a selection race in order to be considered for the team. To be considered for the team all team members MUST be current USATF members prior to running a selection race. Interested athletes should submit running resumes to: Richard Bolt (r_boltski@yahoo.com) and Nancy Hobbs (trlrunner@aol.com).<br>
				<br>
				Athletes interested in the junior squad (must be at least 16 years of age in the year of competition and not yet 20) should contact Dave Dunham, manager of the Junior Team, at dave.dunham@comcast.net, for details. The 2007 Teva U.S. Mountain Running Team will be announced by August 1.<br>
