							<p>Rebounding from a second-place finish in the long jump the day before, <b>Joy Upshaw</b><i> (far left above) </i>claimed her third gold medal at the World Masters Athletics (WMA) Championships with an American-record win in Saturday&rsquo;s W50 final of the 80-meter hurdles.</p>
							<p>Upshaw, a 50-year-old from Lafayette, won the hurdles in 12.19 seconds, well in front of the previous U.S. record holder, <b>Liz Palmer</b>. Palmer, the Folsom resident who set the American record of 12.44 last summer, was second Saturday in 12.46.</p>
							<p>&ldquo;I was so excited,&rdquo; said <b>Upshaw</b>, who previously won gold medals in the 100 and 200 meters. &ldquo;I was trying to focus on my own racing, but it was nice to have Liz there in a competitive race.&rdquo;</p>
							<p>If not for a headwind of 1.9 meters per second at Sacramento State&rsquo;s Hornet Stadium, <b>Upshaw</b> might have challenged or beaten the W50 world record of 12.08, set by Switzerland&rsquo;s Christine Muller in 2009.</p>
							<p>In Friday&rsquo;s W50 long jump final, <b>Upshaw</b> finished second to Australia&rsquo;s Marie Kay. Joy&rsquo;s father, Monte, a former national high school record holder in the event, and her sister, Grace, a two-time Olympian, came up from the Bay Area to watch the long jump final. Kay jumped 17-21&#x2044;4 to Upshaw&rsquo;s 16-103&#x2044;4.</p>
							<p>The WMA Championships conclude Sunday with an early-morning marathon, steeplechase finals and a full menu of relay competition at Sacramento State.</p>
							<p>While Upshaw was winning her third gold medal of the WMA Championships, fellow Pacific Association athlete <b>Ed Burke</b><i> (below) </i>picked up his second win with a solid win in the M70 hammer throw.</p>

							<p><b>Burke</b>, a three-time Olympian from Los Gatos who holds the M70 world record at 193-8, won Saturday&rsquo;s final with a throw of 180-10. <b>Burke</b> had knee surgery earlier this year, but he demonstrated enough of his old magic to also win the WMA weight throw on July 8.</p>
							<p>Four more world age-group records were set on Saturday, bringing the total of world records broken during the July 6-17 event to 23.</p>
							<p>John Altendorf, of Corvallis, Ore., set a world record in the men&rsquo;s 65 to 69 pole vault, clearing 12 feet, 71&#x2044;4 inches. Patricia Peterson, of Albany, N.Y., set a W85 record in the 400 meters of 2 minutes, 7.79 seconds.</p>
							<p>Andrew Jamieson of Australia set a M65 record in the 20-kilometer road race walk event at Land Park, clocking 1 hour, 42 minutes and 56.80 seconds, and another Australian, Anne Stobaus, set a record in the W70 400 meters with her 1:16.53 clocking.</p>
							<p>In other top Pacific Association performances Saturday:</p>
							<ul>
								<li><b>Sharlet Lackey Gilbert</b> of Richmond placed second in the W60 400 meters in 1:11.42.
								
								<li><b>William Ballantine</b> of Carmichael finished second in the M85 400 in 1:54.94.
