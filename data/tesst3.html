/* Tips for Elastic layouts 
1. Since the elastic layouts overall sizing is based on the user's default fonts size, they are more unpredictable. Used correctly, they are also more accessible for those that need larger fonts size since the line length remains proportionate.
2. Sizing of divs in this layout are based on the 100% font size in the body element. If you decrease the text size overall by using a font-size: 80% on the body element or the #container, remember that the entire layout will downsize proportionately. You may want to increase the widths of the various divs to compensate for this.
3. If font sizing is changed in differing amounts on each div instead of on the overall design (ie: #sidebar1 is given a 70% font size and #mainContent is given an 85% font size), this will proportionately change each of the divs overall size. You may want to adjust based on your final font sizing.
*/

	width: 900px;  /* this width will create a container that will fit in an 800px browser window if text is left at browser default font sizes */

} 
.twoColElsLtHdr #header {
	padding: 0 10px;  /* this padding matches the left alignment of the elements in the divs that appear beneath it. If an image is used in the #header instead of text, you may want to remove the padding. */
	background-image: url(/images/Logopage2.jpg);
} 
.twoColElsLtHdr #header h1 {
	margin: 0; /* zeroing the margin of the last element in the #header div will avoid margin collapse - an unexplainable space between divs. If the div has a border around it, this is not necessary as that also avoids the margin collapse */
	padding: 10px 0; /* using padding instead of margin will allow you to keep the element away from the edges of the div */
}

/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. Be aware that if you set a font-size value on this div, the overall width of the div will be adjusted accordingly.
2. Since we are working in ems, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar itself. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
3. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColElsLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
*/
.twoColElsLtHdr #sidebar1 {
	float: left;
	width: 80px; /* the background color will be displayed for the length of the content in the column, but no further */
	padding: 0; /* top and bottom padding create visual space within this div */
	font-weight: bold;
}
.twoColElsLtHdr #sidebar1 h3, .twoColElsLtHdr #sidebar1 p {
	margin-left: 10px; /* the left and right margin should be given to every element that will be placed in the side columns */
	margin-right: 10px;
}

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. If you give this #mainContent div a font-size value different than the #sidebar1 div, the margins of the #mainContent div will be based on its font-size and the width of the #sidebar1 div will be based on its font-size. You may wish to adjust the values of these divs.
2. The space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
3. To avoid float drop, you may need to test to determine the approximate maximum image/element size since this layout is based on the user's font sizing combined with the values you set. However, if the user has their browser font size set lower than normal, less space will be available in the #mainContent div than you may see on testing.
4. In the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs that may occur.
*/
.twoColElsLtHdr #mainContent {
	margin: 0 1.5em 0 13em; /* the right margin can be given in ems or pixels. It creates the space down the right side of the page. */
} 
.twoColElsLtHdr #footer {
	padding: 0 10px;
} 
.twoColElsLtHdr #footer p {
	margin: 0; /* zeroing the margins of the first element in the footer will avoid the possibility of margin collapse - a space between divs */
	padding: 10px 0; /* padding on this element will create space, just as the the margin would have, without the margin collapse issue */
}

    <p class="title"><b>Interview with Linda Somers Smith</b></p>
    <p><b>A</b>t the U.S. Olympic Team Trials-Women&rsquo;s Marathon on April 20, 2008 in Boston, Linda Somers Smith (Arroyo Grande, Calif.) set a U.S. record for women ages 45 to 49. The &lsquo;96 Olympian&rsquo;s finishing time of 2 hours, 38 minutes, and 49 seconds smashed 1984 Olympic gold medalist Joan Benoit Samuelson&rsquo;s currently listed U.S. W45-49 record of 2:42:28. Somers Smith&#151;who celebrated her 47th birthday on May 7th&#151;and Benoit Samuelson both qualified for all six Women&rsquo;s Olympic Marathon Trials, the first of which was held in 1984.<img src="../images/2008/xclindasomers.jpg" alt="Linda Somers Smith" width="320" height="480" align="texttop" class="fltrt" /></p>
    <p>In 1984, Benoit Samuelson was already the U.S. open women&rsquo;s marathon record holder, while Somers Smith was a fledgling post-college runner. Somers Smith didn&rsquo;t begin running until her junior year at the University of California, Davis where she earned All-American honors in cross country and track. After receiving a law degree, Somers Smith scored a breakthrough race at the 1989 California International Marathon where she placed second in 2:33:37. In &lsquo;93 and &lsquo;94 she earned U.S. national marathon titles. In 1995, she placed seventh (first American) at the IAAF World Championships marathon, and was ranked the #1 U.S. female marathoner on the <i>Track &amp; Field News </i>annual list.</p>
    <p>Somers Smith recorded her all-time PR of 2:30:06 at the 1996 Olympic Trials, and went on to place 31st at the Atlanta Olympic Games despite injuring an Achilles tendon during the race. She is the 22nd fastest U.S. female performer of all time.</p>
    <p>Somers Smith, an attorney, is a partner in the law firm of Duggan Smith and Hutkin, LLP in San Luis Obispo, Calif., which she founded. She practices in the areas of business and transaction law, real property, land use, business succession planning, and health care. Somers Smith is married to Steve Smith, a triathlete, and has a 23-year-old daughter, Monica.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Sports psychologist Dr. JoAnn Dahlkoetter couldn&rsquo;t resist contacting Somers Smith after her most recent achievement to explore the mindset of this longtime distance standout.</p>
    <p><b>Pacific Association/USATF:</b> You have now qualified for six Olympic Team Trials-Women&rsquo;s Marathons. What meaning does this have for to you to gain the 45-49 record at this year&rsquo;s Trials, eclipsing Joan Samuelson&rsquo;s mark?</p>
    <p><b>Linda Somers Smith:</b> I enjoyed these last trials more than any other. I was relaxed, not nervous. I wanted to run 2:36, and I ran 2:38, pretty close to my goal. I knew how fit I was. I felt good throughout the race.</p>
    <p><b>Pacific Association/USATF: </b>Is running fast more of a challenge now that you are older?</p>
    <p><b>LSS:</b> When you&rsquo;re older something always hurts. Your body doesn&rsquo;t move the way it used to. Your arms, shoulders, legs, everything is a bit different. For instance, when I wear high heels my legs kill me. In your training it can be just one small thing that throws your body off balance. I don&rsquo;t think that the body is meant to do just running for years and years, so I balance my running with swimming.</p>
    <p><b>Pacific Association/USATF: </b>To what do you attribute your longevity in the sport?</p>
    <p><b>LSS:</b> I started running late, at age 20. So I didn&rsquo;t beat up my body in high school. I&rsquo;ve maintained my motivation for competing. And, I&rsquo;ve always done a lot of cross-training with swimming. That has helped my longevity.<br />
      When I train, I run as I feel. I don&rsquo;t even keep a logbook. I do what my body tells me I need to do. I like to run; it keeps me happy. And I always have a back-up sport, in case my legs aren&rsquo;t fully recovered from a running workout.<br />
      I think enjoying the training is a big part of longevity in the sport. I also love to swim. I need to cross-train to stay healthy. If I&rsquo;m injured, I get in the pool.</p>
    <p><b>Pacific Association/USATF:</b> Did you swim competitively in school?</p>
    <p><b>LSS:</b> I swam when I was younger on a swim team, so I can draw on that background. I do a lot of kickboard work in the pool which helps my legs recover.</p>
    <p><b>Pacific Association/USATF:</b> Many people think Olympians are especially gifted with perfect bodies. Have you had many injuries?</p>
    <p><b>LSS:</b> Actually I&rsquo;ve been injured frequently. I have to take a lot of breaks, so I have not had as many years of consistent running as others. There are long periods of time when I&rsquo;m recovering from an injury. You might say it&rsquo;s like a natural periodization. But I&rsquo;ve always found positive ways to deal with it and get through it.</p>
    <p><b>Pacific Association/USATF:</b> Were there times when you thought about quitting, and how did you get through those?</p>
    <p><b>LSS:</b> After the 2004 trials, I had lot of aches and pains. I was not liking it at all. I had two surgeries, in 2005 and 2006. I had bunion surgery on my foot, which got infected. When you can&rsquo;t use your foot you&rsquo;re very limited. I couldn&rsquo;t even swim as an alternative for a while.<br />
      Then I had problems with back pain and had surgery for that. I had to take four months off from running. At least I was fortunate to have good timing to recover in time for each Olympic period. I came back and was in good shape for the past six Olympic Trials.</p>
    <p><b>Pacific Association/USATF:</b> Tell me about your peak experiences as an Olympian. What are the defining moments for you?</p>
    <p><b>LSS:</b> Everybody approaches things differently. The Olympic Trials was a high pressure situation, but not the end all or be all. For me it was one high stakes performance. It felt like just a long, hard run. The Trials was a great run for me.<br />
      When I was running in the Olympics in Atlanta, though, I had a different take on it. My attitude toward the Olympic experience was colored by my injury. I tore my Achilles. It was extremely painful, a letdown for me. You train so hard for so long, and sometimes you don&rsquo;t get the results you want.</p>
    <p><b>Pacific Association/USATF:</b> As a sports psychologist I know mental training can play a key part in a peak performance. How important do you think the mental element is in your training?</p>
    <p><b>LSS:</b> I think the mental part is incredibly important. Running is 90 percent physical, but the way you get to be physically strong is to get strong mentally. You have to train smarter. The mental element is equally important to the physical component. It&rsquo;s a lot more subtle than the physical part, but equally important.<br />
      The biggest downfall with runners is that they sabotage themselves, for example by picking races based on prize money or running a marathon when they should be running a 10K. The U.S. is a great place. You can run anything you want. There are so many more opportunities, but there are a lot more opportunities to screw up as well.</p>
    <p><b>Pacific Association/USATF:</b> Do you use any type of mental training techniques such as visualization or affirmations to help with performing your best?</p>
    <p><b>LSS:</b> Yes, definitely. I visualize myself not falling back if there&rsquo;s a surge. I visualize myself relaxing during a race.</p>
    <p><b>Pacific Association/USATF:</b> What are your favorite races?</p>
    <p><b>LSS:</b> I&rsquo;d say my best race was the Olympic Trials. My favorite race was the World Championships in 1995 in Sweden (where Linda placed seventh - <i>Editor</i>). I had just come back from surgery. I felt really good the whole race. I was in really good shape. In that race I was going there more for the experience. It was great to be in an all-women&rsquo;s race.</p>
    <p><b>Pacific Association/USATF:</b> What tips do you have for other athletes who might have trouble staying motivated to train and race?</p>
    <p><b>LSS:</b> Having a routine really helps. Try to include running in your social life. It makes training much easier. Then, your friendships center around running. You can do group runs. I&rsquo;d also suggest running in the morning. That&rsquo;s the best part of the day.</p>
    <p><b>Pacific Association/USATF:</b> What are your observations about the sport of running? Where is it going?</p>
    <p><b>LSS:</b> I think it&rsquo;s great that so many young people are running now with awesome performances. I&rsquo;m super impressed. There&rsquo;s more organized group training available with lots of support such as Team Running USA.</p>
    <p><b>Pacific Association/USATF:</b> What personal rewards and benefits have you gained from your running career?</p>
    <p><b>LSS:</b> It&rsquo;s been very rewarding personally. I&rsquo;ve met a lot of great people. I&rsquo;ve gotten to travel and have fun, live a healthy lifestyle. It&rsquo;s very satisfying to have good performances. As an Olympian, I get to watch all the other Olympians. I remember the opening ceremonies of the Olympics in Atlanta. They were fantastic, except they kept us in this pen for eight hours in heat beforehand. The USA team was the last country to march out.</p>
    <p><b>Pacific Association/USATF:</b> Do you have hobbies and other interests?</p>
    <p><b>LSS:</b> My husband and I each have a horse in Arroyo Grande. We ride three times a week. Maybe I&rsquo;ll do a ride and tie [competition] one day.</p>
    <p><b>Pacific Association/USATF:</b> How have PA/USATF LDR programs helped you in your development as an athlete?</p>
    <p><b>LSS:</b> The PA/USATF LDR programs are excellent. When I lived in Northern California, that was the best thing about living there&#151;the training, the clubs, the races. Mark Winitz is a great leader in supporting these events.</p>
    <p><b>Pacific Association/USATF:</b> With your professional career as a lawyer how do you find time for training while being a co-partner in a law practice? How do you balance your running with work and family life?</p>
    <p><b>LSS:</b> It&rsquo;s relatively easy now. I run in the morning, then work all day. It was harder when my daughter Monica was in high school. I had to support her. Now it&rsquo;s easier. Just get a schedule and I stick to it. No matter what your schedule is, you can always work in a run. Anyone can do this!</p>
