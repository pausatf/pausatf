<h2>Weru and Loken Earn Victories at<br>San Francisco Chronicle Marathon</h2>
 
SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. - (August 1, 2004) - San Francisco's patented 
mid-summer cool and mild conditions were made to order for the 27th 
Anniversary San Francisco Chronicle Marathon today. Approximately 7,800 
runners and walkers participated in the featured 26.2-mile marathon, 
marathon relay, two half marathons, and 5K run.
 
Leading the way in the marathon were victors John Weru of Kenya and Susan 
Loken of Phoenix, Ariz. Weru won the men's race in 2 hours, 33 minutes, 
and 41 seconds. Loken topped the women in 2:50:21. They led 3,278 
marathon starters in an event that starts and finishes on San Francisco's 
historic waterfront and tours many of the city's scenic attractions.
 
Both the men's and women's winners breezed to relatively unchallenged 
wins. Weru, 24, who resides and trains in nearby Mountain View, Calif. 
with three other Kenyans, led from the starting gun and never faltered 
over the moderately hilly course. Now, he joins his roommate Patrick 
Kamau, who won last year's race, as a San Francisco Chronicle Marathon 
champion.
 
Weru held company with several of the top men in the accompanying half 
marathon race for 13.1 miles of the 26.2-mile distance. He hit halfway in 
1 hour and 13 minutes. But, over the more hilly second half, Weru was 
alone. Jonah Backstrom, 30, of San Francisco, finished second almost two 
minutes behind at 2:35:39. Vitas Ezerskis, 43, also of San Francisco, was 
third in 2:43:36. Ezerskis, who placed second overall last year, also 
successfully defended his masters (age 40 and over) title.
 
"I'm pleased with my time because mostly I ran the race alone," said 
Weru, who also won this year's Lake Tahoe Marathon. "I'm happy because I 
was running to win. But you really need to have some company on the 
course to run a fast time."
 
Weru finished short of the men's course record of 2:31:46 set by Nate 
Bowen in 2002.
 
Loken, 41, however, missed Magdalena Lewy's women's course record of 
2:50:11, set in 2002 by just 10 seconds. 
 
"My objective was to run the first half easy and then kick it into my 
goal marathon pace, and I think I achieved it," said Loken who qualified 
for and finished 31st in this year's U.S. Women's Olympic Marathon Trials 
race in 2:44:20. "I would have liked to have gotten the record; I gave it 
a shot."
 
Behind Loken, Yukiko Nishida, 42, of Rye, New York placed second in 
3:10:30. Cheryl Tronson, 46, of Bend, Ore. was third in 3:13:45.
 
For their winning efforts Weru earned $1,000 as the overall men's winner 
and Loken pocketed a dandy $2,000 for the women's overall and women's 
masters victories. A total prize purse of $10,000 was distributed in the 
marathon and half marathons.
 
In addition to the marathon, the event offers two half marathons. 
Participants can choose which half marathon they want to run, negotiating 
either the first 13.1 miles or second 13.1 miles of the marathon course. 
The winners of the "first" half marathon were James Sheremeta (1:13:30), 
40, of La Jolla, Calif. and Eileen White (1:31:47), 41, of Piedmont, 
Calif. Peter Gilmore, 27, of Menlo Park, Calif. successfully defended his 
men's title in the "second" half marathon in 1:04:13. Robin Shank, 33, of 
San Francisco was the second half marathon women's winner in 1:30:43.
 
In the accompanying 5K race, San Franciscan Sean Drake, 20, took the 
men's crown in 16:13 and Michelle Gallagher, 18, of Daly City, Calif. 
topped women in 18:01.
 
The marathon's unique "Cause to Run" program allows participants to 
pledge support to any of the event's official charity organizations, 
raise funds, and earn pledge prizes by participating in any of the 
running/walking events. Last year, race participants raised over $110,000 
for local charities that provide valuable and much-needed services for 
the community.
