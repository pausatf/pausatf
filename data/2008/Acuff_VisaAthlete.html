<strong><h2>QUOTES</h2></strong>

<b>Jillian Schwartz - womens pole vault winnner</b>

"It was a pretty good day. I tried out a new run so it worked out pretty well. I jumped 

on Friday in practice and decided to take out the skip and it went well in practice. 

It worked well here. It was pretty consistent. It's a really good track."



<b>Tommy Skipper - men's pole vault winner</b>

"I feel good. Today my coach and I were working on a few things." 

"There's a few things we didn't do, that we will do in my next meet." 

"Overall, today was about a "B" day. I think it is something to work off of. I'm just 

really happy I'm healthy."



<b>Reese Hoffa - men's shot put winner</b>

"I just didn't go out here and throw as well as I should have. I'll go home and correct 

the things that I did wrong tonight. I definitely just wanted to put the mark out there 

to beat for the Visa Championship Series."



<b>Jessica Cousins - women's 4x400m anchor</b>

"I had just finished running the 600, I knew the other ladies would give me the best 

race possible. This was my first meet as a professional."

"I'm proud of what I've done today. I'm going to use every race I've got until June 

as a stepping stone."



<b><font size="3"><font color="#0000A0">Amy Acuff - women's high jump winner</font></font></b>

"I didn't know anything about what to expect tonight. I've been feeling really good 

in practice but sometimes you get all wild with adrenaline before a meet. Tonight was 

good. I wanted to put the bar up for Fred Arnold and for this track to have a record. 

It's a really world-class facility. My goal for the season is to be steady and consistent 

and not jump myself to death."



<b>Jenny Adams - women's long jump runner</b>

"It's been four years since I've jumped. I'm focusing on both the long jump and the 

hurdles this year. I just wanted to see where I'm at in the long jump. My goal is to 

double this year. I feel really good."



<b>Khadevis Robinson - men's 600 yard winner</b>

"I thought I'd be able to get out a bit faster, but those guys got out pretty quick. 

I let the guys come to me. I decided to kick and finish.  Surprisingly, I felt extremely 

good during and after the race. I came through pretty quickly in the 400 and I hope it 

carries over to the 800 next week in Boston."



<b>Josh Norman - men's 55 meter winner</b>

"I wish all my track meets were here. I got out of the blocks okay and it was all 

downhill after that."

"Anytime you get a win, its just going to boost your confidence and it'll carry over 

to the next race."



<strong>Allen Johnson - men's 55mH winner</strong>

"I definitely plan to compete every year until I can't anymore. I haven't run indoors 

since 2005. I'm running basically to get ready for outdoors."

"If I didn't know how old I was, I wouldn't know how old I was." 

"The race (today) was okay. I was a little rusty since it was the first race of the 

season. I'm happy with the way I responded in the middle of the race." 



<strong>Carmelita Jeter - women's 55m winner</strong>

"I tried to get out on the first one and of course I jumped the gun. The second one 

I sat there and had to catch up at the end."

"It feels good to get the cobwebs out."
