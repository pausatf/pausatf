<b><strong>COEUR D'ALENE, Idaho, March 10, 2008</strong></b> - Bart Templeman, founder of Iron Wood Throwers, an Idaho-based non-profit 
organization dedicated to the advancement of American athletes and coaches in the throwing events of track and 
field, today announced the anticipated field of competitors for the 2008 Maui International Discus Challenge 
meet series (formerly known as the Maui "Big-Wind" Discus Challenge).

Twelve international athletes representing seven different nations, featuring reigning IAAF Menís Discus World 
Champion Gerd Kanter of Estonia and past IAAF Womenís Discus World Champion Beatrice Faumuina of New Zealand, 
will join five former United States Olympians and several elite American post-collegiate discus throwers for 
the highly anticipated event to be staged from Tuesday, May 13th through Friday, May 16th at the historic War 
Memorial Stadium Complex in Wailuku, Hawaii.

Several early season world-leading marks, including <font color="#CA0D33"><b>Suzy Powell's</b></font> American Record breaking performance, 
resulted from the inaugural Maui event in 2007.  "<i>We foresee even greater results occurring this year with
the addition of these outstanding foreign athletes,</i>" said Templeman.  "<i>However, our main goal for expanding 
the meet series is to provide our American athletes with highest level of competitive experience possible
prior to the U.S. Trials and ultimately the Olympic Games.</i>"

With its ideal climate and strong prevailing winds, many of these athletes view the Maui event as their best 
opportunity to surpass the current IAAF "A" standard mark (64.50m/211-7 for men, 61.00m/200-1 for women), 
initially required to become eligible for obtaining a coveted spot on their respective National teams for the 
Games of the XXIX Olympiad to be held later this summer in Beijing, China. Undoubtedly all athletes will be 
seeking to harness the power of the legendary Hawaiian trade winds to surpass several long-standing National 
and World Records:

<b><font size="3">Men's Discus</font></b>
<b>American Record:</b> Ben Plucknett, SC Striders, 72.34m/237-4 (1981)
<b>World Record:</b> Jurgen Schult, German Democratic Republic, 74.08m/243-0
(1986)

<b><font size="3">Women's Discus</font></b>
<b>American Record:</b> <font color="#CA0D33"><b>Suzy Powell-Roos</b></font>, Asics, 67.67m/222-0 (2007)
<b>World Record:</b> Gabriele Reinsch, German Democratic Republic, 76.80m/251-11
(1988)

One such athlete is Estoniaís Gerd Kanter, who has recorded the furthest throw in the world for the past two 
consecutive years and boasts a personal best mark of 73.38m/240-9 from 2006, which ranks as the third best 
in history. "<i>There is simply no other place in the world that can rival Maui in its ability to provide such 
great natural resources for elite discus throwing,</i>" said Templeman. "<i>Obviously we're tremendously excited to 
have this much talent assembled as some amazing performances are bound to result.</i>"
