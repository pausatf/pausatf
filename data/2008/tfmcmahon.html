												Some people make the Olympic team on guts and faith. Kevin McMahon might <br>
												make this year's U.S. hammer-throwing roster on serendipity and muscle <br>
												memory.<br>
												<br>
												&quot;Providence, too,&quot; McMahon said the other day, offering another possible <br>
												explanation for how he could end up in Beijing instead of taking his <br>
												regular August vacation to Tahoe with his wife.<br>
												<br>
												You've heard about sports stories that are too good to be true. This one <br>
												is too good not to be true. Here is how it came down:<br>
												<br>
												McMahon, a teacher and coach at Bellarmine College Prep in San Jose and <br>
												at Stanford University, was long retired from his competitive life as a <br>
												two-time U.S. Olympic hammer thrower. But he lost a whimsical bet to his <br>
												Bellarmine pupils. The whimsical bet required the 36-year-old McMahon to <br>
												try to qualify for one more Olympic team, eight years after he made his <br>
												last one for the Sydney Games.<br>
												<br>
												So. Five weeks ago at a Modesto meet, McMahon gave it the old <br>
												what-the-heck try. And he had a holy-cow-can-you-believe-it result. He <br>
												discovered that he's still throwing the hammer farther than all but one <br>
												or two other U.S. competitors.<br>
												<br>
												In other words, if he performs well at the Olympic trials in three weeks <br>
												in Oregon, McMahon has a real shot at representing the United States <br>
												again. No one is more stunned than McMahon himself.<br>
												<br>
												One more chance<br>
												<br>
												&quot;This wasn't like a vision quest or a big comeback or anything,&quot; he said. <br>
												&quot;It's like the universe is giving me one more chance to go out on my <br>
												terms.&quot;<br>
												<br>
												In pursuit of that chance, McMahon again hauled his 16-pound hammer out <br>
												to Moffett Field on Sunday morning, for another of his random training <br>
												sessions. The local throwing community - as always, inspired by Olympic <br>
												legend Ed Burke of Los Gatos - has built a makeshift ring that's tucked <br>
												between two softball fields and Highway 101.<br>
												<br>
												&quot;I like to think of the traffic noise as Olympic crowd noise,&quot; McMahon <br>
												said. &quot;People honk when they drive by and everything.&quot;<br>
												<br>
												If only those honkers knew. Maybe we should tell them, by starting at the <br>
												beginning of McMahon's unlikely adventure.<br>
												<br>
												Hammer throwing is one of those unique Olympic specialties. It requires a <br>
												person to spin the body around like crazy while holding a large ball of <br>
												metal at the end of a chain - and then launching the entire ball and <br>
												chain into the air with a violent heave.<br>
												<br>
												For more than a decade, McMahon launched and heaved well enough to become <br>
												a two-time national hammer-throwing champion and a participant in the <br>
												1996 and 2000 Olympics. However, all this puts major stress on a man's <br>
												body parts. And back in 2004 as McMahon attempted to make one more U.S. <br>
												team, he was feeling the entire menu.<br>
												<br>
												&quot;You name it - my hip, my back, my shoulder, everything was hurting,&quot; he <br>
												said. &quot;My hands and fingers were so swollen, they started to look like <br>
												cartoon hands with big blown-up fingers . . . I was competing because it <br>
												was what I thought I had to do, but it became a bit of drudgery. A lot of <br>
												the joy had been lost.&quot;<br>
												<br>
												Thus, after failing to qualify for Athens, his decision to retire came <br>
												very easily.<br>
												<br>
												&quot;I was done,&quot; he said.<br>
												<br>
												McMahon returned to Bellarmine, his alma mater, and put his Georgetown <br>
												degree to good use. He taught English and computer graphics. He also <br>
												coached weight events for the school's track team. However, hammer <br>
												throwing isn't a high school event. He seldom touched his old equipment.<br>
												<br>
												Then, last spring, four of McMahon's discus throwers issued a challenge. <br>
												The four - Andrew Estko, Stephen Powell, Alex Power and Matt Ramos - made <br>
												McMahon promise that if they all improved their throws by 10 feet or <br>
												more, he would have to try out for one more Olympic team.<br>
												<br>
												&quot;It was kind of a tongue-in-cheek bet, I thought,&quot; McMahon said. &quot;But <br>
												they all did improve that much. So they kept after me. Those guys were <br>
												exactly what I needed to teach me how throwing can be fun again.&quot;<br>
												<br>
												Out for a spin<br>
												<br>
												Six months ago, McMahon also accepted the position of Stanford's throws <br>
												coach, which left him even less time to train. But he managed to squeeze <br>
												in hammer sessions here and there. And his body, no longer hurting, <br>
												responded much better than he thought.<br>
												<br>
												On May 10, McMahon took a few of his Stanford athletes to the California <br>
												Relays in Modesto. He also entered the hammer throw, his first true <br>
												competition in almost four years.<br>
												<br>
												&quot;I had ripped my hand wide open that week,&quot; McMahon said. &quot;I figured I <br>
												might throw 70 meters, which would qualify me for the U.S. trials. But <br>
												when I let go, I didn't think it was a very good throw. After I released <br>
												it, I yelled, 'Oh, no!' &quot;<br>
												<br>
												Then the judges measured. McMahon's distance was 75.08 meters. It was the <br>
												second-best throw by an American this year. And farther than he'd thrown <br>
												in either of his Olympic appearances.<br>
												<br>
												&quot;Part of me thought, 'That's laughable,' &quot; McMahon said. &quot;But all of <br>
												those throws I made over the years, I guess you don't forget. It wasn't <br>
												my first rodeo.&quot;<br>
												<br>
												McMahon can make the U.S. team if he wins the Olympic trials in Eugene or <br>
												if he finishes in the top three and throws the hammer at least 78.5 <br>
												meters to meet the &quot;A&quot; Olympic qualifying standard.<br>
												<br>
												Tough? Yes. But hardly impossible. McMahon's lifetime best is 79.26 <br>
												meters. All it takes is one throw.<br>
												<br>
												&quot;I have promised myself that no one is going to have more fun at the <br>
												trials than I am,&quot; McMahon said. &quot;And that doesn't have to mean I make <br>
												the team. It's just going to be nice to have a peaceful closure on my <br>
												career, whatever happens.&quot;<br>
												<br>
												Honk if you believe in muscle memory. And serendipity. And providence.<br>
