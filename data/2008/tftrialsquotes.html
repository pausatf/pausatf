											<font size="-1">&quot;I reacted well and was able to bring home the win. I'm so excited because we have a great contingent going to Beijing. Should be an exciting next couple of months and I can't wait till August.&quot;<br>
												&quot;I had a few plans depending on how the race went with the wind, but I just tried to stay relaxed and tried to drive through the finish.&quot;<br>
												&quot;I didn't expect to be the favorite and I am just happy with how the year went and with the training. I have always had confidence in myself.&quot;</font><br>

												EUGENE, Ore. - Former Indiana University standout <b>Aarik Wilson</b> from Fallon, Nev. won the finals in the triple jump at the U.S. Track and Field Olympic Trials on July 6.<br>
												<br>
												Wilson's jump of 17.43m (57-2.25) was a new Hayward Stadium record, adding a centimeter to the mark recorded by Charles Simpkins in 1986. Wilson's mark was 20 centimeters better than the second-place jump by Kenta Bell.<br>
												<br>
												Wilson last competed for the Hoosiers in 2005, when he won the last four of his ten Big Ten championships. He was also an All-American ten times at Indiana.<br>

											<font size="-1"><b>Aarik Wilson</b>, Olympic Qualifier, First Place<br>
												&quot;I was just trying to hold it together. I was so nervous being in fifth place. I saw my coach sweating from a mile away. I was just trying to think of everything he told me and make sure I got to the pit. Make sure I was on the board and get to the pit. That worked out. God carried me.&quot;<br>
												&quot;I haven't jumped in awhile. I have been hurt. I have a stress fracture so I haven't jumped much since May. Today I felt like I could put one together. I had to make sure I didn't let nerves get the best of me and make sure I got on the board.&quot;<br>
												&quot;I was diagnosed May 28. I haven't jumped. I haven't ran. I ran twice. I ran the day before I left to come here and I ran the day I got here. I was just praying a lot. I was just praying and hoping I could get one together. My tibia in my left leg has a stress fracture. The doctor told me it was going to take six to eight weeks for me to heal.&quot;<br>

											</font><br>
											<font size="-1">&quot;I just really wanted to have fun out there. I didn't really know how it was going to be. It was just going to kind of be a test for me to see because I never really race this much in a continuous amount of time.&quot;<br>
												&quot;I felt good. The race went out a little slower which was good for me because I still kind of felt like I was in it for a little bit. The final kick I just did as best as I could but it just wasn't there at the end.&quot;<br>
												&quot;I am really happy with the way I have performed these three days.&quot;<br>
												&quot;I learned a lot of things. I learned that I can come out and compete and not be intimidated. At the same time, I learned that I still have a lot of work to do to be up there and perform consistently at this level.&quot;<br>

												&quot;Now that it's finally here, I can safely say -- yes, I'm going.&quot;<br>
												&quot;Once the competition started going, I had confidence in my ability. We have a lot of work to get done. We'll try to raise the level before Beijing.&quot;<br>
												&quot;I'm relieved. After a year of this being my primary concern, my primary goal ... I've centered my life around this. I finally made it. It's a relief more than anything. The rest will start sinking in over the next few days.&quot;<br>
												On moving/training at Stanford: &quot;It's gives you confidence, being in that atmosphere. Everything, the academics, carry over into track. You learn to fight your way through hardship, upsets, misfortune. It makes it that much easier.&quot;<br>

											<font size="-1">Women&rsquo;s pole vault finals:<b>Stacy Dragila<br>
												</b>&quot;Obviously it wasn't a good day. I was healthy. I just didn't feel on. I didn't have my &quot;A&quot; game. It didn't take much to make the team, which I kind of thought all the anxiety of the young athletes ... I just knew I needed to have poise out there. I got a little flustered. I brought out a couple poles and then I picked up the wrong one and second guessed myself on that first one. And then the second one, the wind pushed.&quot;<br>
												&quot;It just wasn't in the cards today.&quot;</font></p>
										<p><font size="-1"><a href="vhttp://www.usatf.org/athletes/bios/Camarena_Jillian.asp>" Jill Camarena</b></a></font><a href="</b>, the high school record holder in the shot put (54-10 3/4), continues to follow in the footsteps of her famous father - and challenge him. <b>Michael Carter</b> set the standing high school shot put record of 81-3 in Sacramento in 1979 at the , considered one of the greatest marks in any event in prep history. Before joining the 49ers, he won the silver medal in the '84 Olympics. <br> <br> &quot;He got the silver, but I told him I'm going to get the gold,&quot; the younger Carter said. <br> <br> The &quot;newcomer&quot; is just 22 years old. <br> <br> &quot;(My dad) always knew I could make it,&quot; she said. &quot;Being so young, there are things to learn, things I need to do well, (but) I'm getting it.&quot; <br> <br> <br> <b>Nelson leads shot putters <br> </b><br> The Peninsula also has provided a member of the men's shot put team, current world leader Adam Nelson. He lived in San Carlos and Menlo Park for several years while training at Stanford. He currently lives in Virginia while working on a master's degree in business. <br> <br> Nelson, Heaston, and Camarena have all trained with former Stanford coach Robert Weir. <br> <br> <br> Locals in top three <br> <br> Two athletes who currently train at Stanford, hammer throwers <b>Kevin McMahon</b> and<b> Sarah Veress </b>(McMahon's pupil), finished in the top three in their events but will miss the Olympics because they have not reached the Olympic &quot;A&quot; standard. <br> <br> Stanford throws coach McMahon, 36, placed second in the hammer throw at 244-5. But only winner A.G. Kruger (248-9) has achieved the Olympic standard of 257-6. <br> <br> A three-time Olympian,<b> McMahon</b> retired after becoming an alternate for Athens with a fourth-place finish at the '04 trials. Also a teacher at his alma mater, Bellarmine Prep in San Jose, McMahon still ranks No. 4 all-time among Americans with his best of 260-0 in 1999. Kruger is the only American to throw that far since 2000, one of the reasons McMahon resumed competition just two months ago, hitting 246-4 in his first meet, May 10 at Modesto. <br> <br> After finishing his Stanford coaching duties at the NCAA championships in mid-June, he threw again at College of San Mateo on June 22 and set a county record of 243-3. <br> <br> &quot;I wanted to come out for fun,&quot; McMahon said. &quot;It's still a thrill for me. My throwing volume is about half of what it used to be. I'm throwing off muscle memory.&quot; <br> <br> Stanford grad Sarah (Hoppins) Veress placed third in the hammer throw with a personal-best 225-1. She fell just short of the standard of 228-0, so fourth-place finisher Loree Smith (220-2) was awarded the Olympic berth. She had achieved the standard earlier this season with a 228-2 throw. <br> <br> Veress, who also chased the standard in the meet at CSM last month (reaching 220-7), was disappointed in just falling short in Eugene. <br> <br> &quot;I have wanted to make the Olympic team ever since I can remember,&quot; she said. &quot;I did my best throw ever today, and it's close enough. Maybe I will get another chance in four years.&quot; </p> </td> <td width=" 11" height="2827"></a></p>
