										the Bay minutes is accepted as permanent, with Presidio being on 10/4 and
<br>
										UCSC being on either 9/13 (if Banana Chase withdraws from the road grand
<br>

<br>
										<br>
										Sponsorship/Fundraising: No report
<br>
										<br>
										VOLUNTEERS
<br>
										<br>
										Women's LDR chair
<br>
										<br>
										Katie Wasilenko of the Impalas (katiewaz@gmail.com) was nominated for the
<br>
										position of acting Women s LDR chair (until bi-annual elections next year)
<br>
										and unanimously elected to this position.
<br>
										<br>
										Board of Athletics positions
<br>
										<br>
										We have several vacant women s LDR positions on the Board of Athletics.
<br>
										The following two runners were elected to these positions:
<br>
										<br>
										Katie Wasilenko (katiwaz@gmail.com)
<br>
										Toni Miller of SWEAT (toniruns@yahoo.com)
<br>
										<br>
										Sanction Monitor: No nominees
<br>
										<br>
										Convention Reps
<br>
										<br>
										Mark Winitz (men s LDR), Lloyd Stephenson (masters LDR), and Irene Herman
<br>
										(women s LDR) were unanimously elected as the LDR delegates to the next
<br>
										USATF Annual Meeting (Reno).
<br>
										<br>
										Road Bid Coordinator
<br>
										<br>
										Katie Wasilenko agreed to fill this position this year, along with women s
<br>
										LDR chair.
<br>
										<br>
										Other current volunteers
<br>
										<br>
										It was mentioned we need an LDR secretary. No nominees.
<br>
										<br>
										LDR BANQUET
<br>
										<br>
										Tamalpa has agreed to host the 2009 LDR Banquet.
<br>
										<br>
										2008 Road Grand Prix schedule
<br>
										<br>
										Rock N Roll Half: We were not able to find away around expo packet pickup
<br>
										for all entrants other than the limited $30 pickup fee, so the San Jose
<br>
										Rock N Roll Half will not be on the 2008 grand prix.
<br>
										<br>
										Humboldt Half: With Rock N Roll Half off, Humboldt becomes 1.5 points for
<br>
										all age groups.
<br>
										<br>
										Seagate Elite 5K: The race was willing to be a double point race for open
<br>
										individuals only at $2650. A motion was made and unanimously approved to
<br>
										grant the race triple points if they are willing to put forth $5300. 
<br>
										<br>
										Banana Chase 5K (and future Rhody events), headphones: There was
<br>
										discussion (no action) of the fact that Dave Rhody has said he will pull
<br>
										his races (starting with the 2008 Banana Chase 5K) from the road grand
<br>
										prix if we continue to enforce the headphone ban as we did at Across the
<br>
										Bay (at which many runners were disqualified until the officials could no
<br>
										longer keep up with the volume of headphone runnersÜat about seventy
<br>
										minutes). It was noted that this is not really our issue, but rather one
<br>
										of the officials. Many points of this multi-faceted issue were discussed.
<br>
										<br>
										Banana Chase: Due to permitting issues, the race has been forced to move
<br>
										its date from 9/21 to 9/14. A motion was made and unanimously approved to
<br>
										accept this change on the grand prix. (And if Banana Chase remains on the
<br>
										2008 grand prix, the UCSC cross country meet will be moved from 9/13 to
<br>
										9/20.)
<br>
										<br>
										Fairness of 2008 changes. The athlete who had expressed concerns about the
<br>
										fairness of changing the 2008 road grand prix schedule after it had become
<br>
										effective (especially in the context of  best of 0 scoring) was not able to
<br>
										come to the meeting, so this issue was not discussed in depth. 
<br>
										<br>
										RULES CHANGES
<br>
										<br>
										Two rules changes were proposed at the last meeting, to be voted on here.
<br>
										<br>
										Rules change 1: The Ultra Subcommittee shall be renamed the MUT
<br>
										Subcommittee. Given that the Ultra chair was not in attendance, it was
<br>
										unanimously approved to postpone this to the next meeting.
<br>
										<br>
										Rules change 2: Effective 1/1/2009, runners will not score that race if
<br>
										they do race day paper registrations, except during specific announced LDR
<br>
										Membership Drives. This was amended with unanimous approval to  Effective
<br>
										1/1/2009, runners will not score if they do race day paper PA membership
<br>
										applications, except during specific announced LDR Membership Drives 0 and
<br>
										unanimously approved.
<br>
										<br>
										TRAVEL FUNDING
<br>
										<br>
										All votes in this section were unanimous. In most cases the selection
<br>
										criteria was voted on separately from the funded race, but they are
<br>
										presented here as one motion. Note:  be sent to 0 means  reimbursed up to
<br>
										$250 to go to. 0
<br>
										<br>
										The female winner of the Marin Memorial Day 10K will be sent to the Tufts
<br>
										Health Plan 10K in Boston on 10/5.
<br>
										The male winner of the Shriners 8K will be sent to the CVS/Downtown 5K in
<br>
										Providence on 9/21.
<br>
										The male and female winners of the Humboldt Half will be sent to the
<br>
										Houston Half on 1/18/2009.
<br>
										The male and female winners of both the cross country grand prix and the
<br>
										PA Championships will be sent to Winter Cross Nationals in February.
<br>
										<br>
										NEW BUSINESS
<br>
										<br>
										Year-end award (not money) depth
<br>
										<br>
										The SWEAT team members in attendance expressed their disappointment that
<br>
										they did not receive any award (e.g., certificate) for their
<br>
										(money-winning) grand prix performances, as had been our prior practice.
<br>
										It was discussed that few people ever picked these up, and the problem was
<br>
										mainly time to create the certificates and time to distribute them. It was
<br>
										suggested that we might develop an automated online way to create your own
<br>
										certificate. The SWEAT members said they would look into it.
<br>
										<br>
										LDR Budget
<br>
										<br>
										The following budget request was unanimously approved:
<br>
										Income
<br>
										Road GP prize money, net $1400
<br>
										XC race fees $800
<br>
										Expense
<br>
										LDR Banquet (awards) $1000
<br>
										Road GP $20,000 (likely $15,000 unless we have similar
<br>
										LDR-related income, mainly B2B insurance fee)
<br>
										XC GP $8,000
<br>
										Ultra GP $3,000
<br>
										Road travel funds $1000
<br>
										XC travel funds $1000
<br>
										Ultra travel funds $1000
<br>
										<br>
										Non-resident athletes: No discussion.
<br>
										<br>
										Rules Changes (new): None.
<br>
										<br>
										Grievance: There is one outstanding LDR grievance, but there was no
<br>
										discussion on it.
<br>
										<br>
										Appeals
<br>
										<br>
										Suzanne Segesta, Zippy & Big Sur: Long-time PA member Ms. Segesta
<br>
										claims to have joined the PA with a paper application at Zippy. The
<br>
										application has not been found. This being a membership issue, Irene
<br>
										Herman membership chair found her claim credible and told Ms. Segesta that
<br>
										if she joins online immediately, her membership will be backdated to Zippy.
<br>
										<br>
										Lindsay Gardina, Zippy: Ms. Gardina joined the PA under her maiden
<br>
										name. She informed the PA that she had been missed in the results (she was
<br>
										third woman overall, which would mean she d receive prize money) after the
<br>
										expiration of the 10-day appeal period. No motion was made to approve her
<br>
										appeal to score at Zippy.
<br>
										<br>
										Other New Business
<br>
										<br>
										George Rehmet announced that Pamakids is hosting the annual national RRCA
<br>
										Convention in San Francisco 3/26-29/09.
<br>
										<br>
										It was moved and seconded that CIM be accepted on the 2008 road grand prix
<br>
										for masters only (for which the race has said that it would be willing to
<br>
										bid). The committee considered two points of order. First, CIM as a
<br>
										masters only race had been discussed at the last meeting. However, since
<br>
										there was no vote (it died for lack of a second), it was determined that
<br>
										it was proper to move its adoption now. The second point of order was that
<br>
										this was a material change to the grand prix and should not be adopted
<br>
										without notice to the PA (it was not in the agenda), but this point of
<br>
										order was withdrawn. While the committee did consider other options, such
<br>
										as leaving it up to the executive committee, meeting again at Shriner s,
<br>
										and having an overall club email vote, in the end the motion was voted
<br>
										upon and defeated, 2-7, with two abstentions.
<br>
										<br>
										Meeting adjourned at 10:58.
<br>
										Submitted by Lloyd Stephenson and Tyler Abbott, acting secretaries.
