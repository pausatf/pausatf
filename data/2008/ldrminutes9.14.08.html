	  <BR>
	  SUBCOMMITTEE REPORTS<BR>
	  <BR>
	  MUT<BR>
	  With no representative present initially, no report was originally given.<BR>
	  After Hollis Lenderking arrived, he reported that Steve Stowers was on the<BR>
	  2008 USA 100K World Cup team.<BR>
	  <BR>
	  Cross Country<BR>Tony Coffey brought up the order of events at PA XC Championship. <BR>
	  A motion was made and unanimously approved to change the event order so that masters men <BR>
	  would run first, women second, if the race director also approved this change.<BR>
	  <BR>
	  Sponsorship/Fundraising: No report<BR>
	  <BR>
	  VOLUNTEERS<BR>
	  Board of Athletics positions, women's LDR:Chair announced that we are still 2-3 <BR>
	  women's LDR positions short on the Board of Athletics, and called for volunteers.<BR>
	  Sanction Monitor:Katie Wasilenko, women's LDR chair and road grand prix bid coordinator,<BR>
	  offered to take this position-to make sure our grand prix races are sanctioned.<BR>
	  National Cross Country Council Rep: Sylvester Coons, a member of the Pacific Striders <BR>
	  open men's team residing in Nevada, has offered to become our national cross country <BR>
	  council rep. A motion was made and seconded to forward to Lloyd Stephenson <BR>
	  Mr. Coons's request and to allow Lloyd to decide whether to appoint him.<BR>
	  <BR>
	  Other current volunteers<BR>
	  It was announced that we could probably use a new cross country chair, as Cary Craig <BR>
	  has been very busy the last year or two. The group was encouraged to think of likely candidates.<BR>
	  In particular, Tony Coffey offered to poll the Aggies.<BR>
	  LDR Banquet<BR>
	  Tom O'Reilly reported that Tamalpa's plans are  proceeding, with the focus now on venue.<BR>
	  <BR>
	  2008 Road Grand Prix schedule 2008<BR>
	  Mile: We have heard no word since the postponement in late June/early July. <BR>
	  It's very unlikely the event will take place this year.<BR>
	  Seagate Elite 5K is open individual only (this was accepted by the race),<BR>
	  double points @ 2650.<BR>2009 Road Grand Prix schedule (Katie Wasilenko chairing; see Appendix A)<BR>
	  1. It was moved and passed unanimously to accept Zippy 5K and Big Sur 5K.<BR>
	  2. It was moved and passed unanimously to accept NorCal 10 miler at<BR>
	  either $3000 (single point) or $4500 (1.5 point), at the race's discretion, <BR>
	  with the race to let us know by 12/1.<BR>
	  3. It was moved and passed unanimously (1 abstention) to reject the<BR>
	  Spangler Memorial 8K.<BR>
	  4. It was moved and passed unanimously to accept the Across the Bay 12K,<BR>
	  Marin Memorial Day 10K (long circuit), and Banana Chase 5K with the following stipulations:<BR>
	  Banana Chase submits a bid, for either single point $3000 or 1.5 point $4500, and each race <BR>
	  may back out if the headphone issue is not resolved to its satisfaction by January 2009.<BR>
	  5. It was moved and passed unanimously to accept the Shriners 8K.<BR>
	  6. It was moved and passed unanimously to accept the Humboldt Half Marathon if they amend<BR> 
      their bid to offer $3000 instead of $2650.<BR>
	  7. It was moved and passed unanimously (1 abstention) to accept the<BR>
	  Clarksburg 30K as a 30K (not as a 20 miler). It was also expressed that<BR>
	  (1) if the race really wanted to offer the 20 miler instead of the 30K, <BR>
	  we could reconsider, and (2) for 2010, if the race wants to offer the 20 miler <BR>
	  instead of the 30K, they should just submit a bid for the 20 miler.<BR>
	  8. It was moved and passed unanimously (1 abstention) to accept the Synaptics <BR>
	  (formerly Seagate) 5K as a double point open individual only race, assuming we receive<BR>
	  a bid ($3000).<BR>9. It was moved and passed unanimously to accept the Christmas Relays on<BR>
	  the same terms as in the past (single point money $3000, single point if 1 week after CIM<BR>
	  if CIM is on the circuit, double point otherwise) if we receive a bid.<BR>
	  10. It was moved and passed unanimously to accept CIM for all age groups if it submits a bid<BR>
	  substantially similar to past bids (but with $3000 prize money). If the race wants to bid for<BR>
	  just certain age groups, that will have to come before the committee (or executive committee again.<BR>
	  Finally, the Fleet Feet Mile expressed that it planned to bid, but without date or venue, <BR>
	  so it is planned to put this before the LDR Executive Committee.<BR>
	  <BR>
	  RULES CHANGES<BR>
	  Motion: The Ultra Subcommittee shall be renamed the MUT Subcommittee. Passed unanimously.<BR>
	  <BR>
	  Grievance<BR>

	  was given to Hollis Lenderking for his great work on this otherwise thankless task.<BR>

	  <BR>
	  NEW BUSINESS<BR>
	  Rules Changes (new): None Appeals: It was mentioned that there was an issue with Impala Lisbet<BR>
	  Sunshine at the GGP XC meet last weekend. Any appeal would not be before the LDR Committee,<BR>
