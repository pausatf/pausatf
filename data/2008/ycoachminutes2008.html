<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Background checks to renew 
membership can start as early as Nov1 to renew and the latest by February 
28, 2009.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Coaches would like to find 
another program besides Club Manager.  We gave them the pros of 
having Club Manager which were:  You can manage your club plus 
enter in meets. A suggestion was made to take a survey of other meets 
and see their programs and see if they are easier to use.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">It was also mentioned that 
there is a problem with officials coaching while their kids are on the 
field a suggestion was made that they have someone to cover for them 
while they watch their kids and then return to their post. It is not 
a USATF rule to have coaches on the field but the discretion of the 
meet director.  It was also suggested that we create a coaches 
box and or passes for coaches to be able to come on the field but that 
suggestion was out voted. Rule 144 No coaches on the field.</font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">If a team was to be able to 
get 5 plus people to want to become officials they will come out to 
what ever the area is and give the test to become a certified official.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Coaches also made the statement 
that at some track meet their athletes misses some of their events, 
we let them know that is the responsibility of the coach the parent 
and the athlete.  </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Feedback on the binders was 
done by the coaches plus additional information was given out to be 
added to the binders.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">No longer will we be deleting 
athletes at the track meet to reduce prices.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Birth Certificate can go to 
Tony or Hika until further arrangements has been made.</font> <br>

meet will be cut down Maria and Debra are working on how long and how 
many people it will take to complete each job function.</font> <br>
</p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Exhibition events can be held

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">USATF cannot control what a 
team does with their funds once they are disbursed to that team.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">USATF cannot do anything about 
a team that takes a spot and then compete AAU.</font> <br></p>
