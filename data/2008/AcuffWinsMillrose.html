NEW YORK - Reigning World Outdoor 1,500m and 5,000m champion Bernard Lagat won the 
Wanamaker Mile for the sixth time of his storied career and two-time Olympic medalist 
Adam Nelson posted a new shot put meet record in front of 12,647 enthusiastic fans 
Friday night at the 101st Millrose Games at Madison Square Garden in New York City. 

The third event of USA Track & Field's 2008 Indoor Visa Championship Series, the 
Millrose Games will be televised on NBC from 3:00-4:00 p.m. ET on Saturday, February 2. 
It will be Webcast by Sportnet next week, available via link from <a href="http://www.usatf.org/">USA Track & Field</a>.

Lagat, who grabbed the lead with a lap and a half to go from Australia's Craig Mottram 
and held on to win in 3 minutes 57.51 seconds, is now tied with National Track & Field 
Hall of Famer Glenn Cunningham, who also owns six Wanamaker titles. Lagat is only one 
shy of the all-time record of seven victories by Eamonn Coghlan.

Mottram was the runner-up in 3:57.90 with Nick Willis of New Zealand finishing third 
in 3:58.14 and NCAA 10,000m record holder and Olympic hopeful Galen Rupp placing fourth in 4:02.17

<b><strong><font size="4">Nelson sets MSG record in Visa men's shot put</font></strong></b> 
Two-time Olympic medalist and 2005 World Outdoor champion Adam Nelson set a Madison Square 
Garden record in winning the Visa men's shot put.  Nelson's winning throw of 22.07 meters/72 
feet 5 inches bettered the Millrose meet record of 21.88 meters/71-9.50 set by 2004 World 
Indoor champion Christian Cantwell last year. Nelson's performance also is the best in the 
world this year. Cantwell was the runner-up with a best of 21.33m/69-11, with reigning World 
Indoor and Outdoor champion Reese Hoffa third with a toss of 21.13m/69-4. For his efforts, 
Nelson was named the Team USA Athlete of the Meet, presented by Visa.

<b><font size="4">Goucher posts comeback victory</font></b> 
The women's mile came down to a trophy dash between 2007 World Outdoor Championships 
10,000m bronze medalist Kara Goucher and two-time NCAA 5,000m runner-up Sara Hall. Hall 
held a slight lead coming off the final turn before Goucher burst past her on the inside 
just in front of the finish line to win in 4 minutes 36.03 seconds. Hall was the runner-up
in 4 minutes 3 seconds.

<b><font size="4">Jeter, Demus win women's sprints</font></b> 
2007 World Outdoor women's 100m bronze medalist and 4x100m relay gold medalist Carmelita 
Jeter won the women's adidas 60 meters in 7.28 seconds in her Millrose debut. 2007 Pan Am 
Games 100m gold medalist and World Outdoor Championships 4x100m relay gold medalist Miki 
Barber was the runner-up in 7.30 seconds. Angela Daigle-Bowen, who was the 2005 Visa 
Championships Series winner, was third in 7.32.

2005 World Outdoor silver medalist and 2006 Visa Champion Lashinda Demus grabbed the lead 
with two laps remaining and held on to win the Visa women's 600 yard run in 1 minute 20.79 
seconds. Angel Perkins was the runner-up in 1:21.31.

<b><font size="4">Great Scott continues indoor success</font></b> 
Reigning World Indoor 60 meters champion Leonard Scott demonstrated his indoor dominance 
again in winning the Metro men's 60 meters in 6.59 seconds. 2007 Reebok Boston Indoor Games 
winner DaBryan Blanton was the runner-up in 6.64 seconds, with 2007 World Outdoor 
Championships 4x100m relay gold medalist Leroy Dixon finishing third in 6.67 seconds.

<b><font size="4">Jackson edges Robinson in men's 600 meters</font></b> 
The Metro Mel Sheppard men's 600 yards was a highly competitive tussle between 2005 World 
400m hurdles champion Bershawn Jackson and reigning USA Outdoor 800m champion Khadevis 
Robinson. Jackson seized the lead with three laps remaining with Robinson seemingly glued 
to his right shoulder. The rest of the race was conducted with Jackson and Robinson 
remaining in that position with Jackson crossing the finish line first in 1:10.34 with 
Robinson finishing second in 1:10.53

<b><font size="4">Schwartz, Skipper, Acuff win vaults, high jump</font></b> 
2004 Olympian Jillian Schwartz posted a personal best with her winning clearance of 4.63 
meters/15 feet 2.25 inches in the adidas women's pole vault.  American outdoor record holder 
Jenn Stuczynski was the runner-up, also clearing 15-2.75. Stuczynski had two misses at 
4.63m/15-2.25 to Schwartz's one miss, which gave Stuczynski the win. 

The Fred Schmertz men's pole vault was won by reigning NCAA Outdoor champion Tommy Skipper, 
who captured the event with a clearance of 5.70 meters/18 feet 8.25 inches. Derek Miles was 
the runner-up with a clearance of 5.60m/18-4.50.

Three-time Olympian Amy Acuff was victorious in the John Thomas women's high jump with a 
clearance of 1.92 meters/6 feet 3.50 inches. 2005 NCAA Outdoor champion and 2007 USA Outdoor 
runner-up Sharon Day was the runner-up with a best of 1.89m/6-2.25.

<b><font size="4">Lopes-Schliep, Hicks conquer 60m hurdles</font></b> 
Three-time NCAA 100m hurdles champion Priscilla Lopes-Schliep got out of the blocks first 
and held on the entire way out of lane two in winning the Hershey's women's 60m hurdles 
in 7.95 seconds. 2003 World 100m hurdles champion and 2004 World Indoor champ Perdita 
Felicien of Canada was the runner-up 8.05 seconds, with Damu Cherry finishing third in 8.07

2004 Olympic Trials champion Teresa Vaill won the women's one-mile national championship 
race walk in convincing fashion finishing in 7 minutes 01.17 seconds, and the men's one-mile 
national crown was won by Ricardo Vergara in 6:29.92, finishing just ahead of his twin

<b>Bershawn Jackson:</b> <i>"Khadevis (Robinson) put a move on me in Fresno a couple weeks ago and 
I couldn't catch up with him". "I wanted to get out in front this time and try to hold on and 
I was able to do that"</i>.

<b>Khadevis Robinson:</b> <i>"Bershawn did what he was supposed to do". "He got out in front and slowed 
the pace down and it worked well for him"</i>. 

<b>Kara Goucher:</b> <i>"Sara swung a little wide coming off the final turn and I was just able to 
sneak in to get past her". "This is awesome". "I haven't run on banked tracks since 1999". 
"This was a lot of fun". "I didn't know I could win here but I thought I could be competitive"</i>. 

<b>Sara Hall:</b> <i>"I gave my best and I'm happy with that". "I'm going to do Indoor Nationals and 
hope to make the world championships team"</i>. 

<b>Teresa Vailll</b>
<b>Women's Racewalk</b> 
"<i>I haven't done this for a long time, so I had some trouble until I got going. I haven't 
worked on speed either. I feel good. I'm ready for a 40km</i>".

<b>Ricardo Vergara</b>
<b>Men's Racewalk</b>
<i>"I started in the middle of the pack and I thought I would finish fourth or so. I'm 
surprised to win"</i>.

<b>Lashinda Demus - Women's 600m</b>
<i>"I had run the 600 in Fresno and a girl caught me right at the end. I wanted to stay in 
the middle of the pack and be there at the end"</i>.

<b>Jillian Smith - Girls High School Mile</b>
<i>"I liked the pace and everyone did a really good job. It was not as aggressive as last 
year. This is a huge deal. Just hearing about it is nothing like experiencing it first-hand"</i>. 
<i>"I was told to get out fast and not get behind. Last year there was a lot of bumping and 
I handled that a lot better this year than last year"</i>. 

<b>Tommy Skipper - Men's Pole</b>
<i>"I was in a good position today and it was good to get 570 again"</i>.

<b>Bershawn Jackson - Men's 60 hurdles</b>
<i>"I executed the same race that I did in Fresno. I just need to work on my strength and 
get ready for the Olympic Trials"</i>. 

<b>Khadevis Robinson - Men's 600m</b>
<i>"He ran a strong race and ran smart. I had to make a move to move past each individual. 
This is the third race that I have put on a spike this year. I don't have the speed yet"</i>. 

<b>Kara Goucher - Women's Mile</b>
<i>"When she went by me on the last turn and then she went wide I was able to get by her. 
This was awesome. I have not run on a banked track since 1999. I was unlike anything 
I had ever done"</i>.
<i>"This race proves that I can kick"</i>. 

<b>Sara Hall - Women's Mile</b>
<i>"I was not sure where she was and I was trying to run her wide. I just want to build 
momentum in an Olympic year and be inspired by Kara"</i>.

<b>Priscilla Lopes-Schliep - Women's 60m</b>
<i>"I was pretty jumpy in the blocks. I can't afford to get a false start and glad I had 
a nice clean race. With the hurdles you have to get out.  If you maintain that you just 
have to focus and be quick in between. I felt like I could have been quicker between 
the hurdles"</i>.

<b>Antwon Hicks - Men's 60m Hurdles</b>
<i>"I had a pretty clean start and much better than last week in Boston. I was a pretty 
solid race and this was a personal best"</i>. 

<b>Carmelita Jeter - Women's 60m</b>
<i>"In all my races, I usually come on at the end. We are trying to work on my start. You 
notice I came on at the 40 and people are ahead of me and I just open up"</i>. 

<b>Leonard Scott - Men's 60m</b>
<i>"I just had surgery on both of my knees in September. I needed to get back in the 
competitive nature. Last week was a snip of the beginning for me and this week I was 
ready. Now it's about getting your rhythm. The sky is the limit"</i>. 
<i>"I pride myself on my start. God blessed me with a great start"</i>. 

<b>Jillian Schwartz - Women's Pole Vault</b>
<i>"This was a PR for me"</i>. 

<b>Stacy Dragilla - Women's Pole Vault</b>
<i>"On my third attempt, I felt pretty good about it. I knew I needed more pole out in front 
on me. I still have some goals that I think I can still attain"</i>. 

<b>Adam Nelson - Men's Shot Put</b>
<i>"I used Reese's shot put. I helped me out a whole lot. Christian had opened with a big 
throw and I had to respond to that. We have proved time and time again that when we have 
the crowd behind us that we can put on a real good show. I know I am in great shape and 
this is the best shape I have been in at this time of year. We all get along real well.
It's a group of guys that have been competing with for a long time"</i>. 

<b>Kyle Merber - Boy's HS Mile</b> 
<i>"The race went out pretty past, a little faster than I have gone out. I was just trying 
to not get box in. With three laps to go I saw my chance and just wanted to run away 
with it. Knowing that Robby goes with about 200 to go, I wanted to go out earlier and 
get ahead of him. These are the kind of things you dream about and so to have it happen 
was great. Having Madison Square Garden above you added to the experience"</i>. 

<b>Bernard Lagat - Men's Mile</b>
<i>"It might have looked easy. Like always I have to prepare myself for a great race. I have 
run with him several time and stick to my strategy that I had prepared coming into the 
race. Before I came to the arena, I had envisioned the race as it happened. I passed him 
with two laps to go"</i>. 
<i>"I enjoy not being crowded"</i>. 
<i>"I am confirming now that I am coming back for next year. If I win, I will share the 
Chairman of the Boards. If I win, I will be the Chairman"</i>.
<i>"When they sing the national anthem before the race, it gives me a boost. With the fan 
support, I am always happy to run here"</i>. 

<b>Craig Mottram - Men's Mile</b>
<i>"The race is what I expect except the pacemaker started slow. That was a little 
frustrating. I knew Bernard was going to come at some point. I had to just hold on"</i>.
