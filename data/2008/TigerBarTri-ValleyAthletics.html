<b><em>A group of elite athletes training for the Olympics joins with a Northern Californian 
youth club to create a track and field powerhouse.  The new organization, Tri-Valley 
Athletics, Inc. (a 501c3 non-profit corporation) will conduct public service programs 
to promote sports, health, and fitness among the youth of Northern California, as well 
as support Olympic bound athletes.</em></b> 
  
<b><strong>LIVERMORE, CA January 28, 2008</strong></b> – The athletes of Tiger Bar Sports (TBS),
an Olympic Track Club, officially joined with Tri-Valley Vault Athletics (TVVA), to form the 
new Tri-Valley Athletics, Inc.

Over the past 18 months TVVA has worked in conjunction with TBS to support and promote these 
local Olympians’ training. Their combined efforts have bolstered the status of track and 
field in the community. 
   
In this short time, this elite group of athletes has grown to include a powerhouse team of 6 
former Olympians and has the potential to generate a total of 17 Olympic berths in this year’s 
Beijing Olympics.  

TVVA, a youth track club founded in 1998, has a well established legacy in building and 
promoting track and field in the community; specializing in uniting youth and elite athletes 
to their mutual benefit.   

With similar missions and highly successful collaborative efforts in bringing public service 
programs to Northern California, the new Tri-Valley Athletics organization is expected to 
further tap the synergies that have brought the previous organizations such tremendous success. 
   
Michelle Doggett, the current TVVA president, will continue on as president of Tri-Valley 
Athletics, Inc.  The board of directors will include respected members of the track and field 
community. 
   
The elite athletes of Tri-Valley Athletics will train at the Stockton facility, located at 
the Port of Stockton, Stockton, Calif., while the youth will continue to train primarily in 
Livermore, Calif.  

The training at the Stockton facility will be overseen and directed by Coach Dan Pfaff, a 
biomechanics specialist who has coached thirty-three Olympians. In his career he has coached 
athletes to 7 Olympic medals, including Suzy Powell-Roos (American Discus Record Holder) and 
Donovan Bailey (former 100M World Record Holder). With world recognized expertise in speed 
and power, Dan Pfaff has also worked with professionals in other sports, including football, 
tennis, and baseball.  

Tri-Valley Athletics offers programs to anyone in the community where they can receive expert 
advice and hands on training from the Olympic track athletes and their coach. Programs focus 
on skills and techniques used to improve speed, strength, and overall power; with additional 
advice on nutrition and healthy living. 
   
Tri-Valley Athletics Inc. is based in Livermore, Calif. The members include American Record 
Holder Suzy Powell, World Championship Gold Medalist Brad Walker, and 3-Time Olympian Amy 
Acuff.  For additional information on this topic or to schedule an interview with Michelle 
Doggett and/or the athletes, please contact:
