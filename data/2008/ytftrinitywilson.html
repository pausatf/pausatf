<h3>Interview : Trinity Wilson of E.O.Y.D.C.</h3><br>
By Alexander Hill (4/23/08)<br>
<br>
<p>
<font size=2>Trinity is a 6th year participant of the Pacific Association. She ran 3 years under the tutelage of Coach William Pittman of 3M Track Club before transferring to E.O.Y.D.C. Two years ago as a Midget at the Junior Olympic Championships, Wilson finished 1st in the 80 meter hurdles earning a Gold Medal and All- American Honors. She is also the current PA Record Holder in both the 80-meter and 100-meter hurdles. She offers and insightful view for those who are willing to dedicate their lives to Track.</font> 

<p> 

<font color="#5F5A59"><b>1. Congratulations on your performance at the National Scholastic Indoor Championships (NSIC) in New York City. Not only was it an National automatic qualifying time of 7.65 (60m) but it was your first big race of the season. What were your expectations heading into the race and how did it feel to be the only 8th Grader competing against such a talented field? </b></font>
<p>

Well, I was excited and a little nervous but it was okay because I love competition. It gives me a lot of adrenaline, and being at such a big track meet makes it even better. I was able to show people that just because I'm an eigth grader doesn't mean I can't compete at a high school level, and compete well at that.
<p>
<font color="#5F5A59"><b>2. Looking ahead to the outdoor season, the 100 meter hurdles seems to be your premier event as the defending Pacifc Association Champion and record holder. However you've had so much success with the 100 meters which one do you feel is the perfect race for you? </b></font>

<p>
I think they are both about equal. The way I feel about both of those events balance each other out. If i know I didn't do so well in one event I will make sure I do fantastic in the other. The hurdles, I push myself more because of the technical aspects so I can run faster. They are the most challenging part but I work hard on that because I know I have the speed, especially from the 100m. The 100m is something that I love and don't worry so much about because it seems to just come to me. If I feel I did not do so well at my other event it is ok because when the 100m comes every worry is away and my mind is clear. It's relaxing for me and it feels wonderful and I just get out there and run and do what I have to do.
<p>

<font color="#5F5A59"><b>3. No female at your age has been able to clock under 14 seconds in the 100m Hurdles and with the record standing at 14.01  (held by Domenique Manning), How do you feel your chances are at making history? </b></font>
<p>

I think my chances at making history are strong because this year I'm going to make sure I get down to a 13.8 in youth hurdles. That’s my goal, it might be far fetched but I'm going to get it because I don't want anyone to break it. I want my record to last for a very long time. But, I know this won't be the last record I'll break and I'm sure of it.  I know that I'm not going to be the only female doing this. All you have to do is try and it'll just come to you and young lady's right now are the ones to do it. We're making history on our own and doing what we have to do, and I think that I can say,"I'm a leader in this movement".
<p>
 

<font color="#5F5A59"><b>4. After running for three very successful seasons at 3MTC, what have been some of the big "behind-the-scene" changes for you coming to a much smaller program at E.O.Y.D.C.?</b></font>
<p>
Independence.  I learned that sometimes you just have to be comfortable standing alone which means being at a track meet without a coach or a team.  It has simply strengthened my independence and focus at a meet.  Just because there may not be a huge team behind me with the same uniforms on it doesn’t mean they are not still cheering me on because they are my biggest supporters – their my family.   3M gave me the foundation and discipline needed to be successful in track.

 <p>

 

<font color="#5F5A59"><b>5. Curtis Taylor (E.O.Y.D.C) has developed a number of great sprinters and hurdlers over the past several years. Where do you see yourself 4 years from now and what would you like to accomplish? </b></font>

<p>
I find myself on top of the world, just doing big things and putting myself out there and showing the world that I work hard.  I will have reached some of my goals. I will be working hard in school and putting track second because my education will always come first. Track is still a sport like anything else and will not always last forever but will always be my first love.

 
<p>

<font color="#5F5A59"><b>6. Perhaps one of the best rivalries this season will be between you and Atiya Harvey of Mission Valley considering you both went 1 and 2 in 100 meters at the Los Angeles Junior Olympics seperated by only a margin of .002 seconds. How much do you look forward to a rematch against a good friend.? </b></font>
<p>

I look forward to good competitive action going on against Atiya.  It will be a good race this year and the two of us will represent California to the fullest…...and it will be one of the most exciting races this season.

 <p>


<font color="#5F5A59"><b>7. You bring a quiet air of confidence to each race – what is going through your thoughts to each race? </b></font>
<p>

Before each race I'm still the talkative Trinity and nothing changes until I see the heat before me, then it's time to get into my running mode. Usually, I will just turn around and zone everything and everyone out of my space and you can tell by my actions. It's not a cocky or arrogance thing either; it's just me getting ready to show everyone what I've trained for.

<p> 


<font color="#5F5A59"><b>8. Now that your youth group  year is about to come to a close and you'll be entering high school next year, what are some of the things you have learned the most during your age group career so far that willl help you going into high school? </b></font>
<p>

The best thing I've learned during my age group career is to have fun and make as many friends as you can, and that's what I do. I make sure I know everone so I can always feel confident in what I do and make others confident and sure about themselves especially the younger kids. Running age group track just shows you that you can do what you want and you don't have to be good at it all the time, because someone will always be better unless you are "A Beast", as they say in track. And I have many friends in track and most are older than me so they give me advice on how to be a better person and athlete, and they are people that I can look up to for whatever. So that showed me during my age group career that track people are nice, they are all my family.

 
<p>

<font color="#5F5A59"><b>9. Your family plays a big role in your life. What have they taught you that you carry with you to each race? </b></font>
<p>
They taught me not to boast about being a talented athlete.  But I figured that out on my own, I don't do that anyway.

 <p>

<font color="#5F5A59"><b>10. When it's time to head home and step away from the ring, how do you like to spend your free time and relax? </b></font>

I like to spend time by being with my family and friends and just hanging out especially with my “cousin” Julian Purvis.  Most of the time I am talking on the phone, on the computer, or texting my friends.  But, to get away from everything I like to just write or go out and eat sushi, especially eat sushi with my god-sister Domininque Corley.  I just live the life of a normal....well not normal actually, UNIQUE thirteen years young track runner.
