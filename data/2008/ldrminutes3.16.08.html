									<font size="-1">
									after the Emerald Nuts Across the Bay12K<br>
											On the benches above the west-end of the post-race lawn, Aquatic Park, San<br>
											Francisco<br>
										<br>
										<br>
										<br>
											Tyler Abbott, men's LDR chair, Lloyd Stephenson, master's LDR chair, Jin<br>
											Daikoku, New Balance Excelsior; Katie Wasilenko, Irene Herman, Impalas;<br>
											Tony Coffey, Aggies; Don Porteous, cross-country co-chair, Ken<br>
										Grebenstein, Phil Phythian, Tim O'Rourke, Tamalpa; Mark Winitz, WVJ&amp;S.<br>
										<br>
											Minutes from Banana Chase 5K meeting 9/16/2007 approved unanimously.<br>
										<br>
											SUBCOMMITTEE REPORTS<br>
										<br>
											Ultra<br>
										<br>
											Hollis Lenderking, who was unable to be present at this meeting, had sent<br>
											an email wondering whether we should rename/repurpose our Ultra<br>
											Subcommittee as a MUT (Mountain Ultra Trail) subcommittee, to be more in<br>
											line with USATF nationally. A motion was made to rename the Ultra<br>
											Subcommittee the MUT Subcommittee, which was then automatically postponed<br>
											to our next meeting in line with our operating rules. Some discussion<br>
											ensued.<br>
										<br>
											Hollis had asked in particular whether the 2007 ultra runner of the year<br>
											award should be open to a Mountain runner (in this case, Chris Lundy). A<br>
											motion was made, seconded, and unanimously passed to refer this question<br>
											to the Ultra Subcommittee for them to determine.<br>
										<br>
											Cross Country<br>
										<br>
											Cross Country co-chair presented a tentative 2008 grand prix schedule. The<br>
											bid packets were not sent out in time, but the race directors were<br>
										contacted in order to allow them to express their  interest. A motion was<br>
											made and unanimously approved to accept the following schedule, assuming<br>
											bids are received by the next meeting:<br>
										<br>
											8/23/08 Empire<br>
											9/6 Golden Gate Park<br>
											9/13 UC Santa Cruz<br>
											9/27 Garin Park<br>
											10/11 or 10/4 Presidio [this will likely be 10/4 since San Jose Rock N<br>
											Roll Half Marathon is not on the road circuit]<br>
											10/25 Shoreline<br>
											11/1 Tamalpa<br>
											11/23 PA Champs<br>
										<br>
										This should be posted on the website as &quot;tentative.&quot;<br>
										<br>
											It was also noted that Fleet Feet Sacramento is debating whether to bid,<br>
											and should decide before our next meeting. [After the meeting Fleet Feet<br>
											informed us that they were not planning to bid.]<br>
										<br>
											Sponsorship/Fundraising: No report<br>
										<br>
											VOLUNTEERS<br>
										<br>
											Women's LDR Chair: Barbara Frank had contacted the committee about the<br>
											position, but the current chairs had not connected with her yet. Katie<br>
											Wasilenko said she might consider it.<br>
										<br>
											Board of Athletics positions: It was noted that we have some unfilled<br>
											Board of Athletics positions, especially representing women's LDR.<br>
											Everyone was encouraged to try to find people to fill these positions.<br>
										<br>
											Road Grand Prix Bid Coordinator: Longstanding Road GP Bid Coordinator<br>
											Susan Beck has moved out of the state, so we are in great need of a new<br>
											person for this position. Everyone was encouraged to try to find someone<br>
											to fill this very important position.<br>
										<br>
											Sanction Monitor: There was a discussion that several of our grand prix<br>
											etc. races over the past few years have lacked a sanction. We are looking<br>
											for someone who could make sure all grand prix races are sanctioned.<br>
										<br>
											Other current volunteers: Don Porteous expressed that he was happy to<br>
											continue as cross country co-chair. No further discussion.<br>
										<br>
											LDR Banquet<br>
										<br>
										A motion was made that, being it's so far into 2008 already, the &quot;LDR<br>
										Banquet&quot; be presented as a very informal (pizza?) picnic/awards ceremony<br>
											after Zippy. This was approved unanimously. New Balance Excelsior will be<br>
											the host, assuming they accept. It was recommended that financing come<br>
											from the clubs/donations instead of, say, $10 from each individual. Awards<br>
											and the awards program would be created as they usually are.<br>
										<br>
											2008 Road Grand Prix Schedule<br>
										<br>
											San Jose Rock N Roll Half Marathon. After determining that the race<br>
											start/corral issue should not be a problem, Abbott read an email from the<br>
											race where they suggested that, while they had not decided absolutely,<br>
											they believed they would be able to issue a limited number (350?) of race<br>
										day pickup &quot;tickets&quot; at $30 each. A motion was made and unanimously<br>
											approved that we would approve the Rock N Roll Half Marathon for the<br>
											circuit only if they allowed something like one person team pickup or a PA<br>
											member desk at the start. It was expressed that we could provide<br>
											volunteers to do anything they wanted us to do to enable this to happen.<br>
											[In post-meeting discussions with Rock N Roll they declined to make such<br>
											provisions, so the race will not be on the 2008 road circuit. BTW, they<br>
											did however offer discounts to PA members--using code USATFPA between 4/1<br>
											and 9/28 gives $10 off individual entries, plus we get one comp entry for<br>
											every 25 people signing up under that code.]<br>
										<br>
											A motion was made that the race be for all age groups (as opposed to open<br>
											only). It was then moved that this be postponed until after resolution of<br>
											CIM's grand prix status, which latter motion was approved unanimously.<br>
										<br>
											Humboldt Half Marathon. It was announced that this race was willing to be<br>
											for masters only, with the same prize money, thereby making it double<br>
											points. It was also decided by acclamation that, if Rock N Roll is not on<br>
											the grand prix, Humboldt will be for all age groups. [With Rock N Roll not<br>
											on the circuit, Humboldt will be for all age groups.]<br>
										<br>
											CIM. The race does not wish to be on the grand prix for open runners, but<br>
											is almost certainly willing to bid for masters. A motion was made to<br>
											approve CIM for masters only, but it was not seconded. [This also has the<br>
											effect of making Christmas Relays double point.]<br>
										<br>
											The previously postponed motion to make Rock n Roll open to all age groups<br>
											(as opposed to open only) was then defeated.<br>
										<br>
											Mile. It was announced that the date of the mile had been moved from early<br>
											June to 7/12, as approved by the LDR Executive Committee.<br>
										<br>
											Seagate Elite 5K. A motion was made and approved to make this race for<br>
											individuals only (possibly cutting the total PA prize money in half),<br>
											assuming this is acceptable to the race (since we have a contract with the<br>
											race stating otherwise). Mark Winitz, who's very involved with the race,<br>
											will take this to the race leadership and see if it's acceptable. If not,<br>
											we will re-address at the next meeting.<br>
										<br>
											NEW BUSINESS<br>
										<br>
											Travel Funding. Because we did not have information about which races<br>
											offered national AADP funding, it was moved and approved unanimously to<br>
											postpone this discussion to our next meeting.<br>
										<br>
											Rae Day Registration. Road scorer Tom Bernhard was not able to be present,<br>
											but Tyler Abbott made a motion on his behalf that we do not attempt to<br>
											sign up participants on race day, but instead maintain a list of who<br>
											wishes to sign up before the race along with their club affiliation, and<br>
											require them to then sign up online later that day. Motion was defeated<br>
										1-7. Mark Winitz then made the following motion: <br>
										<br>
											Effective 1/1/2009, runners will not score if they do race day paper<br>
											registrations, except during specific announced LDR Membership Drives.<br>
										<br>
											Motion was seconded and automatically postponed to our next meeting. Some<br>
											discussion ensued.<br>
										<br>
											Headphones. The committee was reminded that national rules prohibit the<br>
											use of headphones in sanctioned events. The referee for the race today<br>
											(Across the Bay 12K) decided to enforce the rule by recording bibs of<br>
											those who were wearing headphones and disqualifying them (listing them in<br>
										the results but with a &quot;DQ&quot; next to their name), but this turned out to be<br>
											practically not possible after about 70 minutes. It was also announced<br>
											that Dave Rhody has expressed concern about the effect of the ban on his<br>
											race entries.<br>
										<br>
											Non-Resident Athletes. The committee was reminded that, eff. 1/1/2007,<br>
											non-resident athletes are allowed to join the PA but are only allowed to<br>
											score under certain circumstances, e.g., when a program like, for instance<br>
											the road grand prix, is not available to them, or if they are<br>
											grandfathered in (basically by being members for three years).<br>
										<br>
											Rules Changes: No more were proposed.<br>
										<br>
											Appeals: None outstanding.<br>
										<br>
											Next Meeting: It was moved and unanimously approved that the next meeting<br>
											would follow the Marin Memorial Day 10K (since the time immediately after<br>
											Zippy will likely be taken up by the LDR banquet picnic).<br>
										<br>
											Meeting adjourned 12:05.<br>
										<br>
											Submitted by Lloyd Stephenson and Tyler Abbott, acting secretaries.</font></p>
