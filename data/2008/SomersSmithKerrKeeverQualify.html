New Zealand's Aish and Ethiopian Zekerios Win Fifth Annual P.F. Chang's Rock 'n' Roll 

Arizona Marathon Running Down a Dream: Seven women qualify for the U.S. Olympic Team

Trials - Women's Marathon



<b><i>TEMPE, Ariz., (Jan. 13, 2008)</i></b> - New Zealand's Michael Aish ran to his first career 

marathon victory Sunday at the P.F. Chang's Rock 'n' Roll Arizona Marathon in a time 

of 2 hours, 13 minutes 20 seconds. Returning women's champion, Adenech Zekirios from 

Ethiopia, broke the course record of 2:31:33 in her repeat victory, finishing in 2:31:14. 

Also in the women's race, seven American women qualified for the 2008 U.S. Olympic

Team Trials - Women's Marathon.



The 31-year-old Aish looked comfortable and composed in his second marathon appearance 

as he ran a strong race against his African counterparts.



"<i>Sometimes when you're feeling good and out in front, nothing can stop you,</i>" said 

Aish. "<i>This is the highlight of my running career.</i>"



The New Zelander battled Dejene Yirdawe, 29, from Ethiopia over the last half of the 

course. The two men separated themselves from a field of seven as they set a 4:58 per 

mile pace through mile 22.



In the end, it was Aish's persistance that gave him the upper hand as Yirdawe broke in 

the final two miles.



Zekiros, 25, bested countrywomen Salomie Getnet (2:34:01) and Asnakech Mengistu (2:36:18), 

who finished second and third respectively.



The three Ethiopians ran together through the half-marathon mark, until Zekerios emerged 

from mile 14 in control of the lead, having recorded a 5:25 mile. She continued on a 2:28 

marathon pace, which would have shattered the course record, before she began to slow in 

the last four miles.



Victory in hand, Zekerios, lowered the course record by 19 seconds as she broke the 

finish line tape.



Finishing fourth in a time of 2:41:04, <strong><em>Linda Somers Smith</em></strong>, 46, was the first of seven 

American women to qualify for this year's U.S. Olympic Team Trials - Women's Marathon 

in the day's race. Having achieved the Olympic "B" standard by running under 2:47:00, 

these women will now move on to the Olympic Trials in Boston on April 20, the day 

before the Boston Marathon.



Trials qualifiers from the P.F. Chang's Rock 'n' Roll Arizona Marathon include: 

<strong><em>Somers Smith from Arroyo Grande, Calif.</em></strong>, Sally Meyerhoff from Tempe, Ariz., Kristen 

Henehan from Silver Springs, Md., <strong><em>Allison Kerr from Vacaville, Calif.</em></strong>, <strong><em>Betsy Keever 

from San Francisco</em></strong>, Michele Suszek from Aurora, Co. and Lisa Thomas from Alexandria, Va.



Each of the trials qualifiers will receive $500 in addition to any top 10 prize money.



Phoenix resident Susan Loken finished seventh in a time of 2:44:24. Having already 

achieved the Olympic "B" standard earlier this year, Loken had hoped to earn the "A" 

standard by running under 2:39:00.  Tyler Byers, 25, from Sterling, Va., won the 

wheelchair division in a time of 1:45:07.



Through an invitational program titled "Running Down a Dream," 39 women from 19 states 

were hosted by the P.F. Chang's Rock 'n' Roll Arizona Marathon in their quest to join 

the U.S. Olympic Team.



Austin Bailey, 25, from Boulder, Co. finished first among the men in the half marathon, 

and Bridget Duffy, 23, from Berkeley, Calif. was the first woman. Bailey finished in 

1:07:12 and Duffy finished in 1:21:46.
