<p>
Perhaps one of the more memorable performances was in the Youth Girls 200. In a heat that would race four girls under 26 seconds the association top 5 matched up on day two of competition and dropped a bomb! When Alexa Morris (ISC), Sasha Wallace (3M), Alexandra Diaz (LSI), Iesha Hardiman (ISC), Deja Pugh (B# Sharp) and Mission Valley standout, Atiya Harvey took the field a hush fell over the crowd and then it grew to whispers and finally to screams as the girls warmed up sprinting down the track into position to take center stage. As the gun went up people stood out of there seats and crowded the fences for their money's worth of competition. When the smoked cleared it was Alexandra, Alexa and Atiya out quick to first 100 in a time of 12.34. As the positioned started to unfold it was Alexa Morris of ISC out front with Harvey, Wallace and Diaz in hot pursuit. Across the line it would be Morris (ISC) in the drivers seat with Sasha Wallace (3M) sliding into the 2nd with Atiya Harvey and Alexandra Diaz only nine one-hundredths of a second behind to round out the top 4 spots with the final time of 25.54, 25.76, 25.81 and 25.86. A sensational display of speed and beauty the youth girls 200 proved to be a show stopper. 
<p>
Almost equally memorable would be the Youth Boys 200 showdown. A race that would see 3 of the associations top sprinters go sub-24 in its sensational display of strength and speed. Byron Marshall, (Una), Johnny Beard (ISC) and Kenneth Walker (ISC) went 23.11, 23.18 and 23.84 to go one. two, three across the line. Other Highlights included Jordan Riggins of VPAL and Michael Panel of Umoja Track club to round out the top 5 finishers. Riggins and Panel both went 24.42 across the line for an impressive finish in their heats.
<p>
&bull; <b>100 Meters</b>
<p>
In one of the more glamour events the 100 meter drag races took place and people took notice. 
On the girls side the youth girls showed another hot heat. First year youth Alexandra Diaz of LSI ran exceptionally well. She clocked a career-best time of 12.56 to win the first heat and turn in the fastest time of the day ahead of defending Junior Olympic Champion Atiya Harvey (12.66). Cydney Leath of LSI and Alexa Morris of ISC were the only others to run under 13 seconds in 12.99 to make the finals. However in the it would be Alexa Morris to to win the top section of the 100 meters finals in a Personal Best of 12.41 with former teammate and friend Alexandra Diaz of LSI following closely behind to set another Personal Best of 12.53. Missing in the action was defending Junior Olympic Champion Atiya Harvey who earlier pull a hamstring strain in the 200 meter finals. We wish Atiya a quick recover.
<p>
Earlier Nyerin Buckely of 3M would be the only athlete to go sub-13 in the Midget Girls 100 meters in a time of 12.91. It would be Buckley's second individual victory where she earlier won the 200 meters in Buckely fashion. Miesha Gash (Hilltop Speed) took the silver in front of Daijah Colvin of B Sharp who claimed the bronze to seal the top three spots. 
<p>
In the Youth Boys 100 it was another rendition of "Three the Hard way". With Byron Marshall, Johnny Beard and Kenneth Walker at the Helm!  It was Johnny Beard of ISC looking to return the favor in what would turn out to be a drag race to the finish. With the margin of victory only one one-hundredths of a second it would be Johnny Beard in a trade off to take the tape at 11.54. Marshall would be a close second at 11.56 with Kenneth Walker taking the third spot at 11.85 and, Kermit Wright of Phenom Elite with a time of 11.95 to close the deal. Four Boys at sub-12 … should make for some exciting competition when these four match up again.
<p>
&bull; <b>80 Meters Hurdles</b>
<p>
Perhaps the performance of the day goes to the Midget Boys 80 meter hurdles. Umoja played host to perhaps one of the most anticipated showdowns. National ranked #1 seed, Samson Moore (Central Valley) and #2 seed Tyson Hill (LSI) would face off to close a day that has already been filled with great performances. It was Tyson Hill out quick to take the lead over four hurdles with Samson closing fast. Armand Shyne of 3M would surprise the crowd quickly keeping up with Hill over 8 hurdles. With Samson closing fast it would come down to a photo finish with Samson to take the tape at 13.09 and hold his #1 spot. Armand Shyne would edge out Tyson Hill at the finish to take the silver and the #2 seeded spot in the Nation. Tyson Hill would slip into third place and #3 seed in the Nationl and would later say  “I got too comfortable out front and let my lead slip, but luckily there’s a next time so I’m happy with my performances”.  Cheers erupted in the Central Valley’s Camp when receiving the news of Samson victory. It was truly a treat to see the spirit of competition shine through the sometimes win-at-all-cost attitudes. With the Pacific Association having the top three hurdlers in the Nation, we are truly in for a treat the next time these three boys match up at the line.
<p>
Over all it was a day of fun and excitement. With solid showings from many athletes this meet was definitely one of the best we’ve seen in a longtime. On behalf of the Track and Field Community and the Pacific Association I would like to thank Umoja Track Club, Coaches and Staff for hosting a wonderful weekend of excitement. As the Championship season quickly approaches we hope that many more exciting meets will follow.
