										</ul>
									<li>&nbsp;Background checks
										<ul type="circle">
											<li>All Associations except California must comply with the new background screening process; California sticks with the one they have in place today

									<li>Diane Williams wrote a book about her experience at the age of 18 when she had qualified for the Olympics and moved to California and her new club coach &ldquo;Nature Right&rdquo; started giving her &lsquo;vitamins&rsquo; which were really steroids.&nbsp; This is her life story and available at Amazon.com and the book is titled &ldquo;True To Me&rdquo; &#x2026; we should all read it!&nbsp; Bottom line, she had no idea her coach was giving her steroids &#x2026; her book is about how important it is for us as youth coaches to be honest and always be doing what is right for our youth kids
									<li>New Youth Committee has been created that includes these 5 groups
										<ul type="circle">
