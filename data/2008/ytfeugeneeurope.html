											<p><font size="-1" face="Arial">Occasionally we&rsquo;re befuddled by the challenge of trying to be in two places at the same time, forced to decide between Jimmy&rsquo;s track meet or Betsy&rsquo;s recital. &nbsp;Or at the track, deciding to head over to the start of the 100 meters or get one more long jump in before checking out. &nbsp;In Jordan Hasay&rsquo;s case, it&rsquo;s not so simple. &nbsp;Instead of faced with a simple cross-town dilemma, this weekend Jordan&rsquo;s presence is requested at opposite ends of the globe.<br>
													<br>
													Two simultaneous goals have caused quite a conflict. &nbsp;Hasay, a Mission Prep H.S. senior-to-be, didn&rsquo;t learn until Tuesday &#150; at the midpoint of the Olympic Trials &#150; that her provisional mark in the 1500 meters was good enough to earn a spot on the starting line in the quarterfinals on Thursday in Eugene. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s fine and dandy &#150; pretty amazing actually for a high schooler &#150; except there&rsquo;s somewhere else the United State needs her. &nbsp;By virtue of a second straight win at the USATF Junior Nationals two weeks ago at Ohio State University, Jordan also has a date with the world&rsquo;s best juniors in Bydgoszcz, Poland on July 11th. &nbsp;<br>
													<br>
													This will be Jordan&rsquo;s second trip to the world junior track and field meet. &nbsp;Last year in the Czech Republic, she finished second to Kenyan Sammary Cherotich with a time of 4:17.24. &nbsp;This year Cherotich did not qualify, but her countrywoman and 2007 bronze medalist Sheila Kiprotich did. &nbsp;Choosing the 1500 meters has done two things for Jordan: &nbsp;1) made &nbsp;a higher finish possible at the world meet because of the wicked international competition in the 3000, and 2) &nbsp;allowed Jordan to discover success outside of her recent comfort zone of 3200 meters stateside. &nbsp;Despite the fact that Jordan enjoyed success at 1500 meters (4:28.61 and an age group record even before starting high school), Jordan has ripped off three straight 3200 meter wins at the state track meet. (Read more about the 2008 &nbsp;state meet below.) &nbsp;Next June in Fresno, she&rsquo;ll try to join Lindsay Hyatt (800m) and Marion Jones (100m, 200m) as runners who have won their event at the California state meet four straight years.<br>
													<br>
													Jordan will leave for Poland with the rest of the United States team on the fourth of July, allowing her just one day to enjoy the Olympic Trials. &nbsp;But instead of sitting in the Hayward Field stands &#150; and if you&rsquo;re fortunate enough to live in Eugene there&rsquo;s absolutely nothing wrong with that &#150; Jordan will be battling on the track with nine other women in one of the three 1500 meter preliminaries. &nbsp;It will be Jordan&rsquo;s second time racing at Hayward Field and if the past is any proof, Jordan loves this track. &nbsp;She set age group national records in winning the 1500 and 3000 meters at the 2004 Junior Olympics. &nbsp;The venue will look decidedly different on Thursday. &nbsp;And the stakes decidedly higher. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
													<br>
													But win, lose, or draw, Thursday&rsquo;s prelims will be Jordan&rsquo;s only race at the Eugene trials as all junior world members are required to fly out with the national team to Poland at the same time, regardless of their Olympic Trials status. &nbsp;Instead of being deflated about the impossibility of moving on, Jordan is excited about doing her best to still qualify for the semis and take advantage of the competition. &nbsp;Racing this Thursday not only gains her some valuable trials experience for 2012 but also offers a rare opportunity to run in a pack, an experience in the spring which usually lasts about 50 meters. &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t be surprised if Jordan PR&rsquo;s on Thursday when she steps onto the track around 7:30pm. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s preliminaries for most, but for her it&rsquo;s the Super Bowl. &nbsp;(Or at least the FedEx Orange Bowl.)<br>
													<br>
													For the third year in a row, Team Hasay has followed the step-down strategy of focusing on 3 miles during cross country, 2 miles during prep track, and 1 mile during the summer. &nbsp;The results have been nothing short of amazing. &nbsp;In cross country, Jordan has won three straight Division 5 state titles with times ranging from 17:05 to 17:15. &nbsp;She&rsquo;s also won the three straight Footlocker regional races and was the 2005 national high school champion at Balboa Park, only the second freshman to do so. &nbsp;In 2007 (Boulder) and 2008 (San Diego), she also won the Junior Women&rsquo;s race at the USATF Cross Country Nationals. &nbsp;</font><font size="-1" face="Tahoma">As mentioned, in track Jordan </font><font size="-1" color="black" face="Tahoma">has won three straight California state 3200 meter titles and has won several other major races including wins at Arcadia and the Golden West Invitational against strong competition, setting many grade records in the process including a near miss (.21 seconds) at Mary Decker&rsquo;s freshman mile record of 4:42.0. &nbsp;&nbsp;In another display of versatility, she won this year&rsquo;s GWI in F</font><font size="-1" face="Tahoma">olsom with a time (2:09.92) that put her among the top twenty competitors nationally in that event and would have won the California state meet.</font> <font size="-1" face="Arial"><br>
													<br>
													Jordan&rsquo;s first love is the track and she would love to make a run at the national prep records in the 1600 and the 3200 next year. &nbsp;She&rsquo;s now within shouting distance of each and actually held the national federation record in the 1600 meters at one point until Alex Kosinski changed that at the 2007 Sacrmento Meet of Champions</font> <font size="-1" face="Arial">with her 4:38.15. That record is now held by Woodbridge&rsquo;s Christine Babcock at 4:33.82, a mark set at this year&rsquo;s state meet.<br>
													<br>
													Jordan has made admirers in the Pacific Association proud for five years now and seems to be just hitting her stride. Amidst a sea of suitcases in the Hasay&rsquo;s Arroyo Grande household being stuffed for Eugene and points beyond, we were able to catch up to Jordan and have a poolside chat with the soft-spoken dyanamo in order to gain some insight as to why she&rsquo;s had so much success in the sport.<br>
													<br>
													PAUSATF: The Junior Nationals 1500 sounded like a dramatic race. &nbsp;You mentioned the confusion on Saturday with all 13 girls being pulled off the start line just seconds before the gun and getting passed into the finals. &nbsp;What was it like from that point on?<br>
													JORDAN HASAY: Sunday was kind of emotional too because there were thunderstorms and delays and I didn&rsquo;t know what time we were going to race. &nbsp;I was hoping it would be delayed so it wasn&rsquo;t as warm and windy, but we made it through. &nbsp;It was still really windy. &nbsp;The first 300 I didn&rsquo;t really want to lead. &nbsp;I didn&rsquo;t really want to lead the first 800 but we didn&rsquo;t think anyone would lead. &nbsp;But just to be sure I wanted to wait for the first 200 to see how the pace was. &nbsp;And the first 300 we were 54, 55 which is like 4:48 pace and I just had to go far it. &nbsp;So then basically I led for the next 2 1&#x2044;2 laps the whole time and with 300 to go Alex passed me and then Stephanie Morgan passed me and I got kind of nervous because I thought &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve done all this work and I really want to make the team&rsquo; because that was my main goal. &nbsp;So coming into the last stretch I swung wide because I didn&rsquo;t want to lose my momentum and then luckily I passed Stephanie and I thought &lsquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m going to make the team&rsquo;, and that gave me an extra boost of energy to go past Alex. &nbsp;But Alex still finished really strong. &nbsp;It was a PR for her, I think.<br>
													<br>
													PAUSATF: Last year at this same race in Indianapolis you had some doubts whether you could compete with the likes of Danielle Tauro at this distance, and you did. &nbsp;So, you&rsquo;ve shown you&rsquo;re awfully good in cross country and also the 3000/3200, and now you&rsquo;ve shown all this prowess in the 1500/1600. &nbsp;So at this point what would you consider your favorite event?<br>
													JORDAN HASAY: Actually the 1500 right now. &nbsp;Just since I&rsquo;ve had so much success especially at the world level last year. &nbsp;After the state meet I wasn&rsquo;t expecting that much of a big PR (in the 3200m). &nbsp;But right now it&rsquo;s the fifteen. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s been my focus since I was thinking I was going to get into the trials and hopefully still will. &nbsp;I really like it. &nbsp;You have to have speed but you have to have strength too. &nbsp;A lot of people think I have this great kick but really I start pushing it with 800 to go because I have to keep the pace honest. &nbsp;I can kick hard, but off a fast pace some people can&rsquo;t do it.<br>
													<br>
													PAUSATF: When you went to the Czech Republic what was the most fun aspect of the trip and how excited are you to go to Poland?<br>
													JORDAN HASAY: &nbsp;The whole trip was like an adventure. &nbsp;That trip will always be special because it was my first world trip. &nbsp;Everyone was really great. &nbsp;I think the best part about it is getting to know the other athletes: seeing what their training is and being with athletes on the same level as you, that there&rsquo;s someone else that works as hard. &nbsp;Representing the U.S. and wearing the uniform is just amazing.<br>
													<br>
													PAUSATF: &nbsp;You were a top youth athlete in youth track and have been running competitively for a good amount of time now. &nbsp;What is your biggest motivator right now. &nbsp;What drives you to succeed?<br>
													JORDAN HASAY: I just really love it. &nbsp;I love what I do. &nbsp;Even if I could never race again I&rsquo;d still love it because I love the training. &nbsp;When I have to taper for a race I hate it because I like to go out and do my long runs and my tempo runs and my intervals. &nbsp;And also the people involved in the sport, it&rsquo;s incredible. &nbsp;I love going out there every weekend, people like you that are supporting me and just the people that I&rsquo;ve met through the sport, it&rsquo;s incredible. &nbsp;<br>
													<br>
													PAUSATF: You&rsquo;ve done a really good job of balancing your training. &nbsp;A real general question here: what do you think is more beneficial to you - intensity of training, duration of training, or variety of training? &nbsp;Which of those three has been the most important factor to make you a successful runner? &nbsp;<br>
													JORDAN HASAY: &nbsp;Out of all of those three I would have to say a variety of training methods. &nbsp;I haven&rsquo;t had a major injury yet which is really, really big. &nbsp;This year I have been incorporating more and more running into my schedule, but pretty much the swimming and running is balanced. &nbsp;I do quite a bit of swimming. &nbsp;That helps my cardiovascular but I also don&rsquo;t have any pounds on my legs and it helps my overall strength. &nbsp;And I think that&rsquo;s a big secret that really helps. &nbsp;Resistance to injury is one of the big reasons I swim, strengthening my legs and getting off the pavement. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s also fun and gives me something else to do besides run all the time, although I wish I could (laughs). &nbsp;It really helps my legs though. &nbsp;If I didn&rsquo;t swim, my legs wouldn&rsquo;t feel as good as they normally do. &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t necessarily swim hard, more of a short thing after running to help my legs feel better, just recover.<br>
													<br>
													PAUSATF: What are some of the details of your swimming regimen?<br>
													JORDAN HASAY: At the beginning of the season I do about three or four times a week. But actually this track season I cut back on my swimming so I could run more. &nbsp;As I slowly build to each level I can do more running workouts because I have more strength. &nbsp;I swim about the same amount during track as cross country. &nbsp;Once I get into the peak season I don&rsquo;t swim as much (at one time) but I swim more regularly, like 20 minutes every day if I want to, whereas at the beginning of the season I&rsquo;ll swim 30-45 minutes at a time. &nbsp;I usually run in the morning and swim in the afternoon.<br>
													<br>
													PAUSATF: Coach Mando (Dr. Armando Siqueiros) has been great for you to help you get to this point. Could you elaborate on what Coach Mando&rsquo;s training specifics or his style that you appreciate the most?<br>
													JORDAN HASAY: The thing that I appreciate the most is how he&rsquo;s brought me along slowly. &nbsp;He&rsquo;s been amazing. &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t think I would have the same success without him. &nbsp;He&rsquo;s brought me along slowly and his goal for me in ten years is to be still running, happily, and on the world level. &nbsp;We actually don&rsquo;t do that hard of workouts. &nbsp;I get a lot of rest during workouts and we know I could go harder. &nbsp;Each year we incorporate something new, something a little bit harder, a couple more quarters or something. Each year we&rsquo;re just building on it, and I think that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve been able to get PR&rsquo;s every year and get stronger. &nbsp;One of the things that I think will be big for me is long runs. &nbsp;I still need to incorporate those into my training more. &nbsp;Except for the fall of sophomore year, I never really did long runs until this track season. &nbsp;In junior year I did eight milers, but this year we&rsquo;ll go up to ten. Mando&rsquo;s really flexible, he let&rsquo;s me decide what races to do. &nbsp;We&rsquo;ve kind of done the same races each year but this year we are thinking of Woodbridge.<br>

									<td content csheight="1306" width="353" height="1337" colspan="4" valign="top" xpos="432"><font size="-1" face="Arial">PAUSATF: Which race in your whole high school career are you the most proud of?<br>
											JORDAN HASAY: Probably last year in Indianapolis (at the Junior Nationals in the 1500 vs. Danielle Tauro). &nbsp;At the end of the track season everyone was saying how I didn&rsquo;t have any speed and Mando was getting all these emails that I should do shorter races and all these speed drills. &nbsp;And Mando wasn&rsquo;t worried and replied my speed would develop naturally. &nbsp;And in that race when I ran 4:16, it was really, really exciting. &nbsp;Mando and I knew it was there. &nbsp;Especially after this year, people have more confidence in my kick. &nbsp;That race was kind of the turnaround point&#x2026; that I can do it and I can kick.<br>
											<br>
											PAUSATF: If you had to guess, what event do you think you&rsquo;ll be focusing on four years from now and ten years from now?<br>
											JORDAN HASAY: Mando thinks I&rsquo;m going to be better at the longer distances. &nbsp;I think he&rsquo;s right, probably the five and ten. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m not sure about the marathon, because I like the track a lot better than roads and cross country. &nbsp;I guess it&rsquo;s because I started out with track, it&rsquo;s kind of been my love. &nbsp;I want to try a 5k (on the track) before I leave high school so next year I may do that. &nbsp;Eventually I want to move up, but I&rsquo;ll stay where I&rsquo;m at now because of the success.<br>
											<br>
											PAUSATF: What would mean more to you next fall, going under 17:00 and breaking Anita Siraki&rsquo;s course record at the state cross country meet or winning your second Footlocker national title?<br>
											JORDAN HASAY: Oooh, that&rsquo;s a tough one. &nbsp;Probably Footlocker since I won it freshman year and would really like to win it again. &nbsp;It would just be cool to end my season with a win. &nbsp;<br>
											<br>
											PAUSATF: You&rsquo;ve been fortunate to have some great competitors in California and nationwide during your career. &nbsp;What&rsquo;s the most impressive effort in a race by a competitor in a race that you&rsquo;ve won?<br>
											JORDAN HASAY: I would have to say Laurynne (Chetelat) in the state meet. &nbsp;That was such a big PR (for her) and to come that far in one year is amazing. &nbsp;Two years ago she was a soccer player, right? &nbsp;It&rsquo;s just incredible. &nbsp;We definitely did not think that she could run under 4:50 for the last mile and we thought that I could if we went out slow. &nbsp;We thought she would have to push the pace, but she really impressed us with the last mile and her kick. &nbsp;To push me and push herself, it was just great. &nbsp;On the starting line before the race she told me &ldquo;We&rsquo;re both going to break ten minutes today.&rdquo; &nbsp;And then after we crossed the line, she said &ldquo;I told you so.&rdquo;<br>
											<br>
											PAUSATF: And it was equally impressive to see thousands of sprint fans converted to distance fans for one night. &nbsp;On the flip side, what&rsquo;s the most impressive performance in a race by a competitor in a race that you haven&rsquo;t won?<br>
											JORDAN HASAY: Hmmm, the one that comes to mind is when Alex Kosinski beat me in the 1600. &nbsp;(2007 Sacramento Meet of Champions). &nbsp;She just went by me like I was standing still. &nbsp;Oh man! &nbsp;She just had a really good kick. &nbsp;I just remember that in my mind how fast she was going. &nbsp;And she broke the national federation record that I had before that so I was a bit upset, but I&rsquo;m glad I could help her to do that. &nbsp;<br>
											<br>
											PAUSATF: In terms of your college selection, instead of asking which ones you&rsquo;re leaning toward, let&rsquo;s pretend that instead of that game SimCity where you design your own metropolis, you could play SimCollege. &nbsp;So if you could design your own university and plop it down anywhere in the United States, what would it be like?<br>
											JORDAN HASAY: I would want it to have pretty high academic standards and then a lot of running support from the community, kind of like at Oregon at Hayward Field. &nbsp;I heard the stands are full at every meet, which is pretty cool! And then good weather. &nbsp;I want to go someplace fairly close to home. &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t want to be too, too far away. &nbsp;Probably anywhere in the west. &nbsp;<br>
											<br>
											PAUSATF: What&rsquo;s the most unusual recruiting letter you&rsquo;ve gotten?<br>
											JORDAN HASAY: Probably the most unusual for me is when I get letters from Army and Navy. &nbsp;Those are kind of far out. &nbsp;But I don&rsquo;t like the letters that say &ldquo;Dear Prospective Student-Athlete&rdquo;. &nbsp;(laughs) &nbsp;I just kind of throw those away. &nbsp;I like the ones that say &lsquo;Dear Jordan&rsquo;, or the handwritten notes. &nbsp;Those are really nice. &nbsp;I like that. &nbsp;</font></td>
