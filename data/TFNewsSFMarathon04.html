<h2>27TH ANNIVERSARY SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE MARATHON</h2>
NEXT WEEKEND
 
SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. - (July 23, 2004) - Approximately 8,000 runners and 
walkers will mark the 27th anniversary of the marathon race in San 
Francisco next Sunday, August 1, at the San Francisco Chronicle Marathon. 
Race day features a 26.2-mile marathon footrace, two separate 13.1-mile 
half marathons, 4-person marathon relay, and 5-kilometer run/walk.
 
Race weekend also includes the 2004 Healthy Living Expo, Friday and 
Saturday, July 30-31 at Justin Herman Plaza with over 100 exhibitors, and 
running and fitness seminars at the nearby Hyatt Regency hotel. The Expo 
is free to the general public.
 
Complete information about the San Francisco Chronicle Marathon, 
including online registration for all events, is available online at 
www.ChronicleMarathon.com. Or, call the race hotline at (415) 284-9653, 
Email: sfmarathon@westendmanagement.com. Online registration ends at 
midnight of Friday, July 30, 2004.
 
Despite high gasoline prices, a generally challenging economy, and 
fluctuating tourism rates, people of all ages continue to flock to long 
distance races. Building off its recent success, the registration count 
for the San Francisco Chronicle Marathon and companion races has 
increased once again by 20 percent in 2004. Last year, participation in 
the event also increased 20 percent.
 
"Our goal is to top the event's all-time record for finishers," said the 
marathon's race producer, Peter Nantell of West End Management, referring 
to the 7,231 finishers in the 1983 San Francisco Marathon.
 
According to a "state of the sport report" released by USA Track & 
Field's Road Running Information Center last week, in 2003 overall 
participation in U.S. marathon races increased 2 percent, and 4 percent 
in half marathon races - so San Francisco's marathon is growing at a pace 
well beyond recent trends. Last year, there were an estimated 400,000 
finishers in U.S. marathon races, and 465,000 finishers in half marathon 
races. Overall participation in shorter events was slightly down. (For 
the full report, see 
www.runningusa.org/media/wire2004/Wire2004-56.html#story1)
 
Nantell attributes the growth of the City's marathon to several factors:
 
* The marathon course which was changed two years ago and now 
includes a spacious downtown start/finish area on San Francisco's 
waterfront
 
* Superb race organization, runner amenities, and a variety of 
running/walking events - facts widely distributed among runners by word 
of mouth
 
* The enduring attraction of San Francisco as a destination, 
particularly for runners seeking a cool, summer marathon
 
* The marathon's unique "Cause to Run" program which allows 
participants to pledge support to any of the event's official charity 
organizations
 
* Backing from City Hall, the local community, and generous sponsors
 
Among this year's elite entrants: John Weru of Kenya who trains with last 
year's men's winner, Patrick Kamau, in Mountain View, Calif. Weru, the 
winner of the 2003 Lake Tahoe Marathon and third at this year's San Diego 
Marathon, owns a personal best marathon of 2 hours and 17 minutes. To 
date, the women's field is wide open.
 
Kamau captured last year's marathon race with a winning time of 2:35:08. 
Lucy Carr, an American who resides in Juanlespins, France, recorded the 
women's victory in 3:01:56. The San Francisco Chronicle Marathon's course 
records are held by Nate Bowen (2:31:46, 2002) and Magdalena Lewy 
(2:50:11, 2002). The swift all-time race records (compiled from the 
various courses in the marathon's colorful past) belong to Simeon Kigen 
(2:10:18, 1984) and Lesley Lehane (2:35:33, 1991).
 
The marathon and half marathon races feature a total of $10,000 in prize 
money shared among the overall male and female winners in each of the 
events plus the first master (age 40 and over) runners. In addition, the 
first place male and female San Francisco residents in the marathon also 
win a share of the prize money.
 
Although relatively few runners have the talent and determination to 
contend for prize earnings, they flock to San Francisco for a temperate, 
summer marathon for diverse reasons and causes. For example, Beth Hanna 
of East Lansing, Mich. is bringing along her 60-year-old mother, sister, 
brother, and several other relatives, most of whom will be participating 
in their first 26.2-miler.
 
"I figure if my mother lived through the marathon of raising four 
children plus three stepchildren, especially through those teen years, 
she has a good chance of finishing this marathon," said Hanna. "What an 
honor it will be for me to cross the finish line with my mom by my side."
 
Mike Herrin, a physical education and track coach from Tremont, Ill., 
will complete his 36th marathon encompassing 19 states - in San 
Francisco. His goal is to run a marathon in each of the 50 states.
 
Jeff Stevens, M.D. is a self-confessed "nerd" who says he was clumsy at 
sports. The former New Yorker who now lives in Phoenix, Ariz. took up 
marathon running in 1991, but contracted thyroid cancer in 2000. He'll 
run the half marathon in San Francisco clad in New York Yankees' garb.
 
The San Francisco Chronicle Marathon starts at 7:00 a.m. on Sunday, 
August 1 on the San Francisco Embarcadero near the Ferry Building. Early 
starters are allowed to proceed at 5:00 a.m. The marathon finishes in the 
same location. The first marathon finishers will arrive at approximately 
9:30 a.m.
