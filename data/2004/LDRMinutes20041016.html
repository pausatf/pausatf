Minutes of prior meeting, May 9th at Zippy 5K, approved.
 
Committee reports:
Ultra (Lenderking): Headlands 50K race scheduled as 1 pt. event, added
prize money late with no notice in any official PA organ. This amount of
prize money should make it a 2 pt. event. One known complaint. Chair or
his committee to take action. LDR prefers they do something rather than
nothing; organizers to be put on notice of sloppy administration.
Mary Fagan received $500 travel award for recent 100K World Champs. in
Holland.
XC: No report, however vote taken to resolve point value of Crystal
Springs race of Nov. 13. Decision to reverse LDR email vote, and keep race
as 1 pt. per published schedule.
 
LDR Awards Banquet 2005: Impalas have withdrawn offer to host. Discussion
of bigger subsidy, joint effort of two clubs, assessing most or all clubs
$100, permanent host. Agreed new thinking needed to resolve annual problem
of lack of willing volunteers for big chore that loses money. No action.
 
Budget: Stephenson briefly reports that the 2005 PA budget will be similar
to recent ones: lean in general, with the LDR GP at $15,000, possibly
rising to $20,000 as in last two years.
 
Volunteers: No takers yet for two spots on Board of Athletics for women.
Tom Bernhard has offered to assume the road scoring duties starting 2005,
replacing Ed Parrot. Offer gratefully accepted. No volunteer for Secretary.
 
Rules Changes: Proposal for team prize money at GP races again tabled
because of lack of an amendment affecting super seniors, due from Frank
Ruona and Bob Gormley, per minutes of May 9th.
 
New Business:
2005 Road GP schedule: Rejected as submitted. All thirteen races from
March through November accepted in one subsequent vote, with following
provisos: Big Sur and Zippy 5Ks have complete bids by Nov. 12, Shriners 8K
course is known by Nov. 12 (2004 course not well received), and Paso
Robles 10K be 2 points (prize$ doesn't seem to add up at 1 indv./3 team).
Cal 10 rejection tied to widespread dislike of date and reluctance of
sponsor to change same. CIM and Xmas Relays bids appear incomplete or
absent, and are easily dealt with later due to their dates. Note that this
2005 GP schedule has a new race, a 10K April 3rd in Milpitas.
 
Travel funds: No action since no one present is informed.
 
Rules Change Proposals: First one, to 16.4 in LDR Guide, tabled, many
preferring to see a notice date when declined comp status must be stated.
Second one, concerning a new LDR executive committee, also tabled due to
lack of time. Question arose, shouldn't this also include dissolution of
the steering committee from 3.6 and 3.7?
 
Appeals: Wolfpack master women failed to submit scoresheet on time for
Presidio XC, request forbearance. Appeal rejected, consistent with many
precedents.
 
All actions taken in the above were by unanimous vote, usually 7-0.
 
Acting Chair notes that meeting is rather slow and unproductive due to his
imperfect knowledge of LDR Guide, and the absence of LDR Chair, Secretary,
and Bid Coordinator.
 
Next meeting at Clarksburg, November 14th, after the 30K race.
 
Meeting adjourned at 5:25 PM, due to attrition of attendees. Submitted by
Lloyd Stephenson based on notes by Phythian.
___________________________
The very simple LDR Secretary duties:
 
It's easy! Attend the 4 or 5 LDR Committee meetings (which traditionally
follow a Road Grand Prix event) and take minutes. The meetings have become
very well-organized and usually take less than an hour. The minutes should
include:
a) date and location of the meeting
b) attendees list (hand out a paper and pen for attendees to record names,
clubs, e-mails)
c) the time it starts
d) motions that are presented and whether they are passed or not passed
e) the time the meeting adjourns
Please note that you need not include extensive reports of the discussions
-
the purpose of the minutes is to have the basics on record. Type up the
minutes and e-mail to Tyler for a cross check. Before the next meeting
Tyler
will e-mail the minutes and an agenda to Cynci Calvin who will send them
out
to the LDR list and to web master Dan Preston for posting on the web site.
