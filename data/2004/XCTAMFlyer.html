<h2>9th Annual John Lawson Tamalpa Challenge</h2> 

On Saturday, 10/30/04 the Tamalpa Runners will be hosting the 9th Annual John Lawson Tamalpa Challenge 
at the China Camp State Park in San Rafael, CA.  The race has been staged at China Camp the past 8 years 
and we have had the good fortune to experience spectacularly beautiful race days the past 4 years.  

We are lucky to have such a great venue for our race and feel that our course is one of the best on the PA 
Cross Country Grand Prix.  When we obtained our permit from the State of California Department of Parks 
and Recreation they asked that we emphasize a couple of points with regard to the race.  First, during the 
first mile of the course approximately ¾ of a mile parallels North San Pedro Road.  When we run this section 
of the course the runners are to stay on the shoulder of the road and not run on the asphalt pavement.  We 
will have monitors on the course insuring that the runners run on the shoulder and stay off of the asphalt 
pavement.  If any runner insists on running on the asphalt pavement he will be subject to disqualification. 

The second item of concern to the State is parking along North San Pedro Road.  There is plenty of parking 
available along the shoulder of the road.  If you are late getting to the race, you may be forced to park a fair 
distance from the start of the race.  Please be advised that when you do park along North San Pedro Road 
park on the shoulder parallel to the pavement and off of the pavement.  If any vehicles are parked illegally, 
they may be subject to a fine and may be towed.  

We will once again be giving all pre-registered runners a John Lawson Tamalpa Challenge Beer Mug this 
year.  Please come and join us for great cross country race and help us honor the memory of our good friend 
John Lawson.
