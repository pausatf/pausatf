What is AADP?
The USATF Association Athlete Development Program is a cooperative effort
between USATF's national Women's and Men's Long Distance Running
Committees, the races across the  country that host USATF Championship road
races, and the 57 "local" associations of USATF. AADP provides top-level,
local distance runners an expense-paid opportunity to compete in USATF
National Championship races against the best competition in the U. S.
Local USATF Associations select athletes for the Championship races and pay
a portion of the travel costs. The U.S. Championship events offer
additional travel funding and cover lodging, ground transportation, waived
entry, and meals. Members of the LDR Committees organize and coordinate the
effort.
The National LDR Committees determine the guidelines for the program.
Athletes must be 39 years of age or younger, be U.S. citizens, and have PRs
within a given range-10K PRs, for example, between 39:00 and 35:00 for
women, 31:30 and 28:30 for men.
