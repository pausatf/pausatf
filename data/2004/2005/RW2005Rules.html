		<b>II. Eligibility:</b><br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All athletes must be 2005 USATF Pacific members BEFORE they can score points in any race, either as individuals or for teams. Please don't wait until race day to obtain your membership - we cannot guarantee that memberships will be available at all the races. The best way to get a membership is to go to the web site at <a href="http://www.pausatf.org/data/PAMembership.html">http://www.pausatf.org/data/PAMembership.html</a>. Any disputes about membership status shall be referred to the USATF Pacific Membership Committee for a ruling.<br>
		<br>
		<b>III. Standings:</b><br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grand prix points shall be awarded to teams and individuals at each of the grand prix races. Grand Prix standings in each division shall be calculated by adding up the points obtained at the best <b>four (4)</b> of the six (6) races, for teams and individuals. If a seventh race is added, standings will be calculated from the best five of seven.<br>
		<br>
		<b>IV. Team Points Scoring:</b><br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A. All Clubs must be registered 2005 USATF Pacific members BEFORE they can score points as a team. Athletes who are members of clubs that have not registered as a USATF club for 2005 will be considered unattached until their club registers (or they switch clubs).<br>
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B. All USATF rules for team scoring and eligibility shall apply unless specifically excepted in these Rules.<br>
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C. There is only one team division - an age graded division open to athletes of any age or gender.<br>
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D. Teams shall be scored based on the average age graded percentage of the top <b>three (3)</b> athletes for each club. A club may have as many athletes as it likes entered in each race, but only the top three age graded percentages shall count for team scoring.<br>
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E. In order to score for a club, the athlete MUST be registered for that club before the race. Either the athlete must be affiliated with the club in the USATF membership database before the race, or the athlete must have been approved to walk for the club by the USATF Pacific Membership Committee.<br>
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;F. Teams do not need to declare for a race beforehand or submit information after the race. All 2005 Pacific USATF Member clubs and individuals shall be scored according to their official club affiliation.<br>
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;G. Only one team from each club may score - no &quot;B&quot; teams will score.<br>
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;H. Points are scored at each race as follows. All USATF Pacific Teams with at least 3 USATF Pacific member finishers shall receive at least one point:
