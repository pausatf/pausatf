Rules change proposals
 
Limit number of races in Road Grand Prix to 12; even up number of
races in each (short/long) grand prix to 6/6, possibly having one 10K in
each {Trimble}
 
Revise comp entry system by changing sections 16.2 & 16.4 {Trimble}:
New Rule 16.2: Comp entries will be given to the top 15 open
runners, regardless of age. The top 10 masters not included in the
open comps will also receive comps. The top 5 seniors, not included in
the masters and open, will receive comps. The top 3 super-seniors,
not included in open/master/senior comps will receive comps. The top
veteran not included in the open/masters/seniors/super-seniors comps will
receive a comp.
New Rule 16.4: In the Road and Cross Country grand prix, in
order to be eligible for comped entries, an athlete must have competed in
at least 50% of the races in the series on which the comps are based. If a
runner is ineligible for failing to meet this requirement, the next
eligible runner shall receive the comped entries.
 
Relay Comps {Abbott}. Add new section 16.5: In relay events, there
are no individual comps, but teams who received money in the prior year's
grand prix shall receive complimentary entries.
