Approved Races for 2006:  The new rules for the 2006 Grand Prix Road Race
Series require that there be no more than 14 races plus a relay in the
series.  In keeping with these guidelines, a motion was made and
unanimously approved to accept all the races listed above except LSI Logic
and Applied Materials 5K, assuming that CIM makes a bid [CIM date is
12/3/2005]. <br>
<br>
A motion was made and approved unanimously to accept the LSI Logic race,
provided it is the 5K and the date is April 23. <br>
<br>
Another motion was made and unanimously approved to allow Heritage Oaks to
be a single point race for open and masters or a double point for masters
only or a double point for all  categories as the race director chooses. <br>
<br>
A motion was made, seconded, and unanimously approved to make Heritage
Oaks 10 part of the „Long‰ series so that there will be 6 races in the
long (NorCal10, Emerald Nuts, Heritage Oaks 10k, Humboldt Half,
Clarksburg, and CIM) with the remaining 8 being in the short series. <br>
<br>
Road Runner Center Record Keeping:  The failure of race directors to
submit results in a timely fashion was discussed as a chronic problem. 
This submission is needed for validation if records are set.  As of this
meeting, only Cal10 and Shriners 8k have submitted the 2005 results.  It
is the responsibility of the Race Director to see that the paperwork is
submitted.  Often the Race Director will delegate this responsibility to
the timing company.  Referees should remind the Directors of this
requirement.  The usual time frame for submission is 30 days following the
race.  Mark Winitz made a motion to require races to turn in all paperwork
and results RRIC by the end of the year for 2005 only.  Beginning in 2006,
the 30 day rule will be enforced.  This motion was amended as follows. 
For all races that occur prior to August 15, 2006, if the paperwork is not
received by September 15, their Grand Prix bids for the following year
will not be accepted.  For races that occur after August 15th, 2006 if
their paperwork is not received by December 31 of that year, their Grand
Prix bid will be revoked.  The motion and the amendment were passed
unanimously. <br>
<br>
Scoring Appeals:  Three scoring appeals were discussed and it was
recognized that there had been repeated web site problems with the
submissions.  The site is set up so that the scorer should get an email
confirmation.  It was emphasized that this confirmation is important.  It
is the responsibility of the scorer to follow through on this.  The email
confirmation should be saved until after the posting and the teams confirm
the accuracy of the scoring.  A motion was made that teams be required to
keep these emails if they want an appeal to be considered. This motion was
postponed automatically to the next meeting. It was suggested that in
addition to the web site submission, as a back up, the scorers should
submit the score sheets manually to Tom or Dan directly with a read
receipt added to the message to make certain it was received. <br> 
<br>
Aggies‚s scoring appeal at the Mile was unanimously approved.  
Wolfpack‚s scoring appeal at Santa Cruz was unanimously approved. 
WVTC's scoring appeal at Garin Park was unanimously approved. <br>
<br>
APPEALS:  In order to deal with protests in a timely fashion, the commitee
was reminded that the LDR Executive Committee can settle these protests by
email. <br>
<br>
RATING SHEET:  Mark Winitz proposed making a rating sheet for feedback
from the races suggesting this will be a valuable tool for all clubs.  It
was suggested that the Grand Prix coordinator would take charge of
collecting and summarizing these data.  Mark will work with Doug to
develop a full questionnaire. <br> 
<br>
RACE DIRECTOR RECOGNITION AWARD:  MarkWinitz made a motion which was
seconded and unanimously approved to give an award for Race Director at
the banquet.  It was stipulated that to be eligible for this award, the
director must have submitted all paperwork and for RRIC in a timely
fashion by the set deadlines. <br>
<br>
FOLSOM/SHORELINE POINTS:  A question was raised about the listed points
for cross country races Folsom (1.5) and Shoreline (1.0) for 2005.  Last
year the points were reversed.  In the absence of the Cross Country Chair,
Dave Ahn will check with the .  It was motioned, seconded and unanimously
approved to allow a change to be made if these were originally listed
incorrectly. <br>
<br>
The next meeting will follow the Clarksburg 30k on November 13, 2005. <br>
<br>
The meeting was adjourned at 11:42 am. <br>

APPENDIX A: RULES CHANGES/LDR GUIDE HOUSEKEEPING<br>
<br>
The following suggested rules changes/LDR Guide housekeeping were all
proposed by Lloyd Stephenson. Those that are not truly rules changes but
just involve the proper implementation of previously-approved changes and
policies may be voted on at this meeting, whereas proper rules changes
would normally be proposed here and voted on at the next meeting.
References to „parts‰ are to the appendix to this agenda. <br>
<br>
Motion LS-I: Approve from part A the suggested corrections to these 
sections: Introduction, 1.1b, 1.1c, 4.1, 7.3 (with eligible replacing 
invited), 9.3, 10.2, 11.1,  12.2b, 13.2a, 13.2g, 13.2h, 14.5, 15.1, 
15.2, 16.1, 17.1, 18.3, 18.4, 18.5. <br>
<br>
Motion LS-II. Approve part C, which is all changes to the LDR Guide 
approved since January 2003, excluding changes reported from the May 
2005 LDR meeting. (This includes changes to sections  14.3, 9.4, 15.2, 
16.1, 16.4, 3.6, 3.7 ; and new sections 3.8, 11.4, 13.2a,  22.2, 14.3a, 
16.5.) <br>
<br>
Motion LS-III.  Approve the balance of part C, limited to a listing of 
LDR Guide changes apparently approved in May 2005. <br>
<br>
Motion LS-IV. Any proposed change or addition to this Guide shall specify 
by number which section it affects, or suggest a new section number. 
New Section 22.3. <br>
<br>
Motion LS-V. This leaves part A sections 3.1 through 3.4, 4.4, 9.4, 10.3,
11.3, and  22.1, where I pose questions about intent, meaning, implementation, or 
effect. These can be approached as the Chair sees fit, probably one at 
a time. None are urgent, yet I feel some should see action this fall: 
9.4, 10.3, and especially 11.3. <br>
<br>
Motion LS-VI. Approve part B, which deals with the grand prix race
contract. <br>
