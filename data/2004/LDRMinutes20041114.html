note 1: 
3.6 The LDR Committee has an Executive Committee composed of the
following:
 
(a) The three PA/USATF LDR Chairs (open men, open women, masters).
 
(b) Subcommittee Chairs as designated by the LDR Committee.
 
(c) Two PA/USATF athletes representing one each open and masters, who
are selected by the PA/USATF Athlete's Committee annually. In the event
that the Athlete's Committee does not select these representatives, the
LDR Committee shall appoint them.
 
(d) Other appointees (temporary or permanent) designated by the LDR
Committee.
 
3.7 The LDR Executive Committee examines and organizes current LDR
issues
and makes recommendations to the LDR Committee proper in order to make LDR
meetings more productive and efficient.
 
3.8 The LDR Executive Committee shall also have the right to determine
matters which would otherwise
be determined by the LDR Committee but which arise between LDR Committee
meetings and whose resolution in the judgment of the LDR chairs cannot
await the next LDR Committee meeting. If in the determination of the
LDR chairs such a matter is of too great an import to be adjudicated by
the LDR Executive Committee, they may request that clubs vote by email.
Such a vote, sent to all the official club contacts and to the LDR egroup,
if existing at the time, and in which each
club has the maximum number of votes to which it is entitled, has the same
force and effect as if it were made at an LDR meeting. Clubs must have at
least ten days to respond to any such email vote.

___________________________
The very simple LDR Secretary duties:
 
It's easy! Attend the 4 or 5 LDR Committee meetings (which traditionally
follow a Road Grand Prix event) and take minutes. The meetings have become
very well-organized and usually take less than an hour. The minutes should
include:
a) date and location of the meeting
b) attendees list (hand out a paper and pen for attendees to record names,
clubs, e-mails)
c) the time it starts
d) motions that are presented and whether they are passed or not passed
e) the time the meeting adjourns
Please note that you need not include extensive reports of the discussions
- 
the purpose of the minutes is to have the basics on record. Type up the
minutes and e-mail to Tyler for a cross check. Before the next meeting
Tyler will e-mail the minutes and an agenda to Cynci Calvin who will send
them
out to the LDR list and to web master Dan Preston for posting on the web
site.
