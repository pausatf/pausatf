&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All athletes must be 2004 USATF Pacific members BEFORE they can score points in any race, 
either as individuals or for teams.  Please don't wait until race day to obtain your membership - we

been approved to walk for the club by the USATF Pacific Membership Committee.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;F. Teams do not need to declare for a race beforehand or submit information after the race.
All 2004 Pacific USATF Member clubs and individuals shall be scored according to their official club affiliation.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;G. Only one team from each club may score - no "B" teams will score.<BR><BR>
