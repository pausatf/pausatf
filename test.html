Come True for Maggie Vessey</b></font> <br></p>

Maggie Vessey won the women’s 800-meter race at the prestigious Herculis 
Super Grand Prix meet in Monaco on July 28, the resident of Santa Cruz, 
Calif. stunned the world. Vessey’s time of 1 minute 57.84 seconds 
was a world-leading mark in 2009, and the fastest time by an American 
since Jearl Miles-Clark topped the U.S. list in 2004 with a 1:57.27 
clocking. Vessey’s performance now ties her for seventh place with 
Joetta Clark on the U.S. all-time list.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times">For Vessey, 27, her first sub-2:00 achievement—and 
new personal record by more than two seconds—couldn’t come at a 
more opportune time. The 5-7, 127-pound athlete’s race in Monaco was 
just three days before the IAAF’s qualifying deadline for the World 
Outdoor Championships in Berlin, Germany (August 15-23). By bettering 
the IAAF’s “A” qualifying standard of 2:00.00, Vessey earned a 
spot on the Team USA roster headed to the Championships.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times">“I’m in a dream right now. It’s 
more than my wildest imagination,” Vessey said from her Santa Cruz 
home where she was taking a short breather before heading to Berlin. 
“To run 1:57 and be ranked among the best Americans ... to be ranked 
number one in the world ... they’re things I didn’t even dare to 
dream about.”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times">For sure, the 2005 graduate of Cal Poly-San 
Luis Obispo has registered an outdoor season beyond most people’s 
imaginations. Besides making her first national team, Vessey ran rapid-fire 
personal bests four times at 800m in the space of two months leading 
up to Worlds. Going into the ’09 campaign, her PR was 2:02.01 which 
she recorded while placing fifth at the 2008 U. S. Olympic Track &amp; 
Field Trials. Last May 30th, Vessey lowered that PR to 2:01.49 at the 
Reebok Grand Prix Classic meet in New York.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times">But a huge win a week later in 2:00.18 
at the Nike Prefontaine Classic demonstrated Vessey’s real potential—a 
talent in which the USA Track &amp; Field Foundation had invested by 
awarding her an elite athlete developmental grant of $4,000 last April. 
The victory at Pre, where she beat reigning Olympic champion Pamela 
Jelimo, opened doors for the graduate of Soquel High School. She obtained 
sponsorship support from New Balance.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times">Athlete manager/agent Ray Flynn, who 
brought Vessey into his stable of world class athletes last Spring, 
now had a solid performance to get the athlete invitations to prominent 
meets. And, the invitations came—to compete in the biggest meets on 
the European tour.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times">After placing fourth in the 800 meters 
at the U.S. Outdoor Championships in Eugene last June, she needed those 
big international races to chase the sub-2:00 standard that would give 
her an opportunity to earn a slot on the U.S. World Champs team.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times">Vessey’s 2:00.13 (another PR) win at 
the Golden Gala meet in Rome, Italy on July 24 came exceedingly close 
to the standard. Four days later she faced her last opportunity, in 
Monaco.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times">How did she deal with the pressure?</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times">“I think a lot of it was taking the 
focus off of the standard and making the world team. I told myself that 
life goes on. It wasn’t a life or death situation,” Vessey said. 
“If I made the team, then awesome. If not, there still would be other 
opportunities ahead. But, deep down there was a part of me that said 
I could do it. All season I’d been going into new territory,”</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times">Vessey began the race in lane one and 
decided that was the best place to position herself to save the precious 
time she needed. After one lap she was positioned towards the back of 
the pack. But, with 200 meters remaining, still running on the rail, 
a gap opened in front of Vessey allowing her to move up behind leader 
Mariya Savinova of Russia. Appearing relaxed and in control, Vessey 
swung to the outside on the final turn and swept past Savinova to victory.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times">“Finally, it all came together,” 
said Vessey’s coach, Greg Brock, about the Monaco race. “It seemed 
for a long time Maggie’s workouts were way ahead of what we were seeing 
in race results. And, part of it was Maggie taking a risk and getting 
involved in the race. When Maggie slipped that gap, it was an athletic 
movement that she did beautifully. After that I said ‘Maggie you can 
do it now.’”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times">Vessey’s early roots as a 400 meter 
runner might also have helped her in a race where nine women broke two 
minutes.</font> <br></p>
<p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Times"><b>Early Dream Almost 
Escapes</b></font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times">In high school, Maggie Vessey competed 
at 400 meters for Monte Vista Christian High School (Watsonville, Calif.), 
and then transferred to Soquel High School (Soquel, Calif.) as a prep 
junior. She competed at the California high school championship state 
meet three times at 400 meters. Her prep PR of 54.60 came in her senior 
year at the Golden West Invitational. Vessey holds the Santa Cruz County 
high school records for 200 and 400 meters.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times">When Vessey graduated in 2000, her mother, 
Cher, gave her a surprise graduation gift: She took her to the U.S. 
Olympic Track &amp; Field Trials in Sacramento.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times">“I remember watching and being in awe 
of the athletes there,” said Vessey, “I was about to head off to 
the college, and I just kept thinking, wow, maybe one day I can do this. 
Going to the Trials became my dream.”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times">Vessey’s prep productivity at 400 meters 
earned her an athletic scholarship to Cal Poly-SLO where she moved up 
to the two-lap distance under the wing of veteran coach Terry Crawford. 
As a senior, Vessey placed second at the 2005 NCAA Championships in 
2:03.1. She was also a two-time Big West Conference champion in the 
800.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times">After college graduation, Vessey moved 
to Southern California and joined the Santa Monica Track Club under 
the wing of Joe Douglas. It was a frustrating experience, according 
to Vessey, as she struggled with injuries in 2006 and 2007.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times">“I’d go out to practice and I just 
wasn’t able to run,” she said.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times">Vessey was in pain and she didn’t know 
why. She moved back home to Santa Cruz where she sought solace and support 
from her mom, and her sister, Katy, with whom she lived rent free. Eventually, 
a stress fracture of the femoral head in her hip was diagnosed. At that 
point, Vessey seriously thought about giving up track.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times">“I hadn’t been productive in the 
sport in three years,” Vessey said. “I didn’t want to be the person 
who was hanging on to a dream that wasn’t going to come true. I couldn’t 
afford an apartment. I kept asking myself ‘where are you in life?’”</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times">She started looking for jobs in Santa 
Cruz. Several times Vessey began filling out applications for the Peace 
Corps, but each time she put them down and headed out for an easy run.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Times"><b>Back On Track</b></font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times">Eventually, her hip healed and the young 
athlete began doing some of her favorite workouts “for fun” on the 
track at Santa Cruz High School.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times">That’s where, in early 2008, Vessey 
hooked up with Greg Brock, the Santa Cruz High School and Santa Cruz 
Track Club coach whom she had informally known since her early prep 
days.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times">“My first thought was that I’ve never 
coached anyone with this kind of talent,” said Brock , a two-time 
All-American at Stanford who placed fifth at the 1972 U.S. Olympic Marathon 
Trials. “Then I got to thinking, who are you trying to kid?”</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times">Brock’s experience in coaching stretches 
back to his days as a prolific high school runner. As a student of the 
sport, he provided advice to his friends on other teams. He eventually 
went on to obtain a Masters degree in Exercise Physiology.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times">Said Vessey: “What I liked immediately 
about Greg is that he didn’t start telling me what I <i>should </i>
be doing. Instead, he started asking me questions. What have you been 
doing? What do you want to do? I was pretty strung out at that point. 
I was open to listen, and he had the right things to say. He had an 
honest, authentic approach. Most importantly, he began rebuilding my 
confidence in myself.”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times">Brock shifted Vessey’s training away 
from over-distance and higher mileage, a regimen with which she was 
never very comfortable. Today, her training schedule is more suitable 
for a middle distance athlete who can flourish when she stays healthy. 
It incorporates running quality rather than quantity, solid cardiovascular 
and strength training workouts in the exercise room, and time for recovery. 
Vessey doesn’t keep a log of weekly mileage.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times">“Maggie has a great work ethic,” 
Brock said. “And, my system depends on consistency and not getting 
athletes injured. If they show up every day, you can [help the athlete] 
make seamless improvements from one day to the next.”</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times">Indeed, Brock was instrumental in resurrecting 
Vessey’s dream of competing in the Trials and lifting her light-years 
beyond. Although her then-PR of 2:02.01 at the ’08 Trials was less 
than a second out of coveted third place, Vessey wasn’t disappointed.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times">“Just making the final and placing 
fifth was amazing for me,” Vessey related. “It was a rebuilding 
year. I was coming from a point where I hadn’t stepped on a track 
in two years. I never thought I could make the team, so when I got so 
close, I exceeded every dream.”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times">And, what about Vessey’s astonishing 
season just one year later when she finds herself, literally, on the 
top of the world? Has the magnitude of her accomplishments sunk in?</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times">“People have been telling me that I 
should have been running these times years ago, but I just didn’t 
believe them,” Vessey admitted. “I wasn’t ready to do it. And, 
now, I still don’t know if I’m ready to do it. But, I am.”</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times">Plus each big step, all the way to the 
World Championships, gives Maggie Vessey more reason to believe in herself.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times">“I guess now I have the confidence 
to get to the starting line and just roll the dice. There’s a lot 
more I want to accomplish. And, hopefully, I’ll drop down a little 
further on that U.S. list,” she said.</font></p>
