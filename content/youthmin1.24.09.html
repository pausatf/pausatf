								</ul>
								<p><b>Golden West-PAC</b></p>
								<p>We have decided that wristbands will be handed out so that spectators will not be charged to enter the Golden West if they attended the PAC once the Golden West start they may have to pay.&nbsp; We will have to work from the beginning to the end of the meet.&nbsp; There is also no cost for the association to use the facilities.&nbsp; We will also be combining the use of the officials.</p>
								<p><b>Top 3 update David Lawrence</b></p>
								<p>This year the top 3 will be held in Bakersfield.&nbsp; Reason for the top 3 to be hosted in Bakersfield, CA is he could not find enough support form the Fresno area.&nbsp; Question was asked that our association has more clubs why would we have them travel to Bakersfield when we can get Granada High School for no cost?&nbsp; Does he have Officials and who was doing the timing?&nbsp; David is suggesting that we will not have to work and the coaches will just have to coach.&nbsp; Because the central group does not have the knowledge and the expertise of hosting a meet of this magnitude a suggestion was also made to David that we host the meet here this year and that we train the Bakersfield s group of volunteers for the experience they can keep the money just pay for our expenses.</p>
								<p>The multi&rsquo;s will be held at Liberty High School in Bakersfield.&nbsp; Track and Field will be held at ?????&nbsp; College on Friday and Liberty High School on Saturday and Sunday.&nbsp; David received much opposition to having the Top 3 meet in Bakersfield.</p>
