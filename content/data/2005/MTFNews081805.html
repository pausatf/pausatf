<h2>Sacramento Brooks Fleet Feet Racing Team<br> 
Wins National Masters Track and Field Championships</h2>
<pre>
<p>
The Brooks Fleet Feet Racing Team of Sacramento, California captured the 
team championship at the National Masters Track and Field Championships 
in Honolulu, Hawaii this past August 4th though the 7th.  Brooks Fleet 
Feet totaled 555 points, easily outdistancing the pre-meet favorite So 
Cal Track Club by 170 points.  Forty three members of the club competed 
in Hawaii, all earning medals and scoring points for the team.  Many were 
running in their first track meet ever and competing in events for the 
first time.   

Top individual scorers on the team were two ladies who had done some track
in high school but only got back into running recently doing road races, 
Debbie Zakerski and Terri Lowe of Elk Grove.  Debbie competed in 12 
individual events scoring 58 points for the team and ran in three relays.  
Debbie took four individual gold medals, including the pole vault, which 
she had started learning about three weeks before the meet.  The national 
meet was her first competitive pole vault ever.  She also won three other 
new events for her, the shot put, discus and the hammer.  One of her 12 
individual events was the five event pentathlon and Debbie took second in 
her first pentathlon ever.  She also scored in the 100 (5th), 80 meter 
hurdles (3rd), 400 hurdles (2nd in her first running of the event), long 
jump (3rd) and the high jump (3rd).  Only a very tired body kept her from 
placing in the 200 and 400.  

Terri not too long ago started running to get back into shape.  She, like 
Debbie ran road races including a marathon.  In Hawaii she competed in 8 
individual events and two relays scoring 40 individual points.  Terri took
gold in the 100 hurdles and placed in the 100 (4th), 400 (6th), long jump 
2nd), high jump (2nd), shot put (2nd), discus (3rd) and pentathlon (2nd).  
Most of these events she was doing for the first time.  

The team won 21 other gold medals including eight in the relays.  The relay
gold medals were won in the 4 x 100, 4 x 400, and 4 x 800 by the 30 to 39 
women of  Cindy Marks, Terri Lowe, Valerie St. James, Mary Woo, Trudy Mohr, 
Maria Gickman and Monique Lucero and the 50 to 59 women of Edyth Leek, 
Sherri Rowland, Racquel Smith, Yvonne Nickel, Kathy Ward and Rushty Barnett.
  The 40 to 49 women’s 4 x 100 relay team of Karen Jeffers, Mary Woo, Theresa
Brown and Kim Kimber and in the men’s 50 to 59 4 x 100 and 4 x 400 relay 
teams of Hulan Washington, Dave Kalb, Jim Glickman, Parker White and Vance 
Jacobson.

Individual gold medals were won by 10 other individuals.  Three of them by 
Rachel Menge who in here first track meet took gold medals in the 30 to 34 
1500, 5000 and 10,000 meter runs.  Two gold medals were also captured by 
Demitrius Snaer who in the 30 to 34 age group won both the 100 meter and 
200 meter dashes by just .01 and .02 seconds respectively.  Odette Dunn, 
women 45 to 49, Kathy Ward, women 50 to 54, and Steve Kollars took gold 
medals in the first steeplechase races they had ever run.  Additional gold 
medals were won by Monique Lucero (women’s 30 to 34 800), Karen Jeffers 
(women’s 40 to 44 5k), Theresa Brown (women’s 45 to 49 5k), Rusty Barnett 
(women’s 60 to 64 5k) and Yvonne Nickel (women’s 55 to 59 10k).
