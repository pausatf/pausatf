<h2>PA Cross Country Championship Shirts Available</h2>
<i><b>(there were more entrants than took shirts)</b></i>

T-shirts from the November 6th Western Regional and Pacific Association 
Cross Country Championships in Golden Gate Park are available two ways: 

1) From SF Running & Walking, 275 Fifth Street, San Francisco, CA 94103.  
If you send an unmarked race bib (proving you didn’t get a shirt already),
we will send you a shirt for only $5, which is for shipping and handling.
If you just want an extra of this classic “X-C” design, send a check for 
$10.  All checks to SF Running. Any requests received before December 15 
will arrive by Christmas. 

2) Go to the New Balance store, 222 Sutter Street (between Grant and 
Kearney) in SF, present an unmarked bib, and you can get a shirt for no 
cost.  If you want a second shirt, it’s $10. Their phone number:  
415-788-6273.  Best parking is at the Sutter-Stockton garage nearby.  

Note:  All the shirts are Large.  If you didn’t get one at the meet race 
day, or you want another for a souvenir of this year’s screaming-fast 
championships, send in your request now for a shirt while the supply lasts,
or pick up one at the New Balance store.  
Questions?  Email tim@sfrunning.com, or call SF Running & Walking at 
415-348-6254.
