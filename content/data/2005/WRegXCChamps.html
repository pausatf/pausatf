USA Track &amp; Field Western Regional Cross Country Championships<br>
San Francisco, Calif.<br>
November   6, 2005<br>
<br>
Paulo Carvalho (Asics Aggies) and Erika Aklufi (See Jane Run) led their<br>
respective teams to victory today at USA Track & Field's Western Regional<br>
Cross Country Championships in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park. The<br>
event also served as the cross country championships for the Pacific<br>
Association of USATF.<br>
<br>
Both competitors won in convincing fashion. Carvalho, , 25, of Modesto,<br>
Calif. completed the men's 6-mile race over damp trails, horse paths, and<br>
meadows in 30:33, 11 seconds ahead of runner-up Luke Meyer of the Nike<br>
Farm Team. Three more Aggies followed in places 3 through 5, with five<br>
Aggies in the top 10, to garner the men's open title.<br>
<br>
Former Cal-Berkeley standout Bolota Asmerom, dressed in warm-ups, exited<br>
the three loop course after two circuits, relinquishing the lead to<br>
Carvalho and Meyer. Carvalho prevailed in the final two miles over<br>
Yale-grad Meyer who was competing in his first post-collegiate race.<br>
<br>
"I raced for the win," said Carvalho, who almost gave up running because<br>
of injuries after completing a collegiate career at Cal Poly-San Luis<br>
Obispo two years ago. "When Bolota dropped out, I saw a green light, and<br>
I said 'I gotta' go now.'"<br>
<br>
The move gave Carvalho his first major post-collegiate win.<br>
<br>
Aklufi, 29, completed the women's 4-mile race in 22:49, easily defeating<br>
marathon standout Magdalena Boulet (nee Lewy) and University of<br>
California-Santa Barbara redshirt Lindsay Christman. The win puts<br>
Aklufi's Southern California-based See Jane Run team in fine position to<br>
successfully defend their open women's title at the upcoming USA Track &<br>
Field National Club Cross Country Championships in Rochester, NY on<br>
November 19th.<br>
<br>
"This race showed a pretty good representative mix of what our girls are<br>
going to see [in Rochester]," said Aklufi. "There are a few other fast<br>
girls around the country, but I think we're in as good a shape as<br>
anybody."<br>
<br>
Dan Nelson, 41, and Rosemarie Lagunas, 43, won the masters titles.<br>
