		This has really turned into something special for our community&#148; says Mitch Massey Senior Vice President of Sales, Marketing and Advertising for Heritage Oaks Bank and Race Director, when asked about the Sixth Annual Heritage Oaks Bank Family Fun Day and Fun Run. 
		<p>On Sunday morning September 26th, the downtown Paso Robles City Park and city streets will have some of the world's top 10K runners showcasing their talents. One of the marquee events is the Masters 10K National Championship. This will be the second of five straight years the governing body, United States of America Track and Field (USATF), has Paso Robles host such a prestigious event. The Masters Championship brings the best runners in the country, age 40 and older, to the Central Coast. </p>
		<p>This event is also complimented by the California 10K Championship which showcases the very best 10K runners in the country. &#147;</p>
		<p>This distinction brings instant credibility to Paso Robles as one of the marquee stops in the country for runners&#148; says Massey. &#147;The $56,000 dollar prize purse makes it the largest for a 10K race in the state and second largest purse for a 10K in the country&#148; adds Massey. </p>
		<p>The City of Paso Robles plays a major role along with Heritage Oaks Bank in bringing the running world to Paso Robles. &#147;</p>
		<p>Success breeds success&#148; says Paso Robles Mayor, Frank Mecham. &#147;As Paso Robles continues to bask in the limelight, in part due to the incredible array of events and activities, so too does the Heritage Oaks Bank Family Fun Day and Fun Run. If you&#146;ll notice, the emphasis is on FUN. And, Paso Robles knows fun. From world-class athletes to local amateurs, you&#146;ll enjoy the competition as well as the after-race activities&#148; adds Mecham. </p>
		<p>Something else to look forward to this year: a visit from Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. Since the devastating earthquake hit Paso Robles and the Central Coast on December 22nd the governor has promised a return trip. He&#146;s looking at this event to follow through on that promise. He would like to help in re-dedicating the city of Paso Robles and to be the official race day starter. His final answer will come mid-September, so stay tuned. </p>
		<p>The Heritage Oaks Bank Family Fun Day and Fun Run is first and foremost an event that the entire Central Coast community can come together and enjoy a day packed with all sorts of activities. Besides the 10K race there are six other events to participate in. There is a 5K race, 1 mile run, &frac12; mile kid&#146;s race, 75 yard kid&#146;s dash, 2 mile walk, the ever popular 100 yard mascot race. Any mascot who enters has an equal chance for the grand drawing prize of $500. Plus there is the Diaper Dandy Dash for Cash where each infant is eligible for a $250 grand prize. </p>
		<p>Also included for participants is a pancake breakfast, pizza, smoothies from Jamba Juice, water from Culligan and energy drinks from Propel. Each entrant also receives a collectable race t-shirt from Yesterday&#146;s sportswear and a finisher&#146;s racing medal. </p>
		<p>If this isn&#146;t enough, the park activities include a children authors festival, pony rides, Zoo to You petting zoo, giant play structures for the kids, climbing wall and reverse bungee jump. </p>
		<p>New this year will be the ASA Demo Team. This world-class talent of professional X-game athletes will be performing two shows that will include skate boarding, bikes, in-line skates performed on their state of the art pro-half-pike. </p>
		<p>As an organization this is an opportunity our entire bank staff has to work together in a truly &#147;FUN&#148; event&#148; says Heritage Oaks Bank President/CEO Larry Ward. &#147;No where else on the Central Coast can so many people take part in a family-oriented event while at the same time doing something that has so much benefit to the community all at one time&#148; Adds Ward. </p>
		<p>Another big drawing card for this event is the great prize giveaway. KSBY-TV news personality Tony Cipolla will be back once again as the &#147;Official Prize Master&#148;. Anyone who enters has an equal chance to win one of three trips to Hawaii compliments of Traveltime, a VIP experience at the Radiers-Bronocs NFL football game, plus mountain bikes from K-Man Cyclery. For a list of all other prizes please visit the Fun Run website at www.hobfunrun.com or pick up a race brochure at any Heritage Oaks Bank branch office. &#147;</p>
		<p>Yet another part of this event that makes it so unique is that 100 percent of all race entry fees go back into our local non-profit community&#148; says Massey &#147; Each year we select four different recipients. To date over $70,000 has been raised in a few short years for our non-profit community. This year all proceeds will be divided equally to support these non-profits: Paso Robles Public Library, Food Bank of SLO County, Friends of Hearst Castle Educational programs and the Paso Robles Children&#146;s Museum&#148; adds Massey. </p>
