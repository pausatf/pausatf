<h3>New XC Race Aug 20? Vote by July 21</h3>

<pre>

After being unable to find a non-conflicting date for Crystal Springs 

This year, West Valley Track Club has come up with a new cross country venue 

In the East Bay and a new date (August 20). The date is earlier than we've 

started the cross country season in the past, but this is largely 

Because the grand prix ends two weeks earlier than normal (due to the early 

date of club nationals). Also note that currently we have eight races in the 

grand prix, as opposed to ten last year; in any case, teams and 

individuals still score the top six. Details of the new race appear below.



A yes vote means that you vote to approve the new race, while a no vote 

means rejects the new race. 



Please remember that each club receives one vote if they have an open men's 

team, one vote if they have an open women's team, and one vote if they have 

any master/senior/etc. team. Thus, depending on the teams a club fields, 

each club can have up to THREE votes. Be sure to specify in your vote which 

club and which individual team (open men's, open women's, or masters') you 

are representing. 



If you are not an official team representative but would like to have

input on this vote, please contact your team representative/captain as

soon as possible



Please check with your club members and respond by THURSDAY JULY 21, 

2005 to Cross Country co-chairs Cary Craig (cacraig@ucdavis.edu) and Don 

Porteous (PorteousD@gao.gov)

<h3>PA, Ultrarunners Present LDR Awards at Ninth Annual Banquet</h3>
<i>(from Hollis Lenderking)</i>
On February 27 the Pacific Association and Bay Area Ultra Runners hosted the 
ninth annual awards banquet at Wente Vineyards in Livermore.  A total of 74 
awards encompassed all three LDR disciplines of road, cross-country, and 
ultra, and honored not only all the age-division winners (individual and team) 
in each Grand Prix, but also such exceptional landmarks in the association's 
LDR community as the most outstanding runners, volunteers, and individual 
performances of 2004.
 
One particular highlight of this year's ceremony was an entertaining address 
entitled "Becoming Human: The Role of Endurance Running" by Professor Dennis 
Bramble, a Cal Berkeley-trained biologist at the University of Utah, who has 
been acclaimed recently (New York Times, Runners' World) for his pioneering 
research into the role of long-distance running in early hominid evolution.  
Based on the findings reported in his recent Nature magazine article (11/18/04), 
Professor Bramble's presentation outlined the salient points of his hypothesis 
that endurance running, as opposed to sprinting (which humans do poorly compared 
to most quadrupeds), may have been instrumental in our evolution.  
 
Examination of the physiological and anatomical record indicates that, in short, 
we are built for distance, not speed, so take that, Mo Green!  Perhaps it is no 
coincidence that the greatest distance runners on the planet hail mainly from 
the region that provides the richest fossil record of early human locomotion.  
In a more practical vein, next time you are bemoaning your latest bout of plantar 
fasciitis or Achilles tendinitis, just consider that we are singularly blessed by 
these adaptations: we needed protein long before we had tools and weapons, and we 
were never going to outsprint the antelope and cheetah in our quest.  Hey, we're 
not just smart, we're good!
 
Back on the western shore of North America, the PA's most decorated runner of 2004 
was Menlo Park's Peter Gilmore, whose multiple honors included his repeat selection 
as Road Runner of the Year (ROY).  To this he added Cross Country ROY--an unprecedented 
double-honor for a PA male--and a pair of performance awards: the California Track & 
Running News Best Road Performance of 2:14:02 at CIM, a time that also earned the 
27-year-old a rare dual citation for best age-graded performance.  
 
Impalas' fast-rising star Megan Daly likewise swept the women's ROY honors for both 
road and cross-country, while the CTRN performance award went to Magdalena Lewy Boulet 
for her 55:32 at Cal 10M, and the indefatigable Shirley Matson, 63, earned the age-graded 
award for her 33:48 at the Shriners 8K.  Ultrarunning ROY awards were presented to a pair 
of phenomenally durable prior honorees: Rena Schumann (her fifth) and Mike Sweeney (his 
third consecutive).  These two must be getting all the protein the sprinters never reach.
 
Fittingly, a club that excels at all three LDR disciplines was celebrated with its third 
Club of the Year award for Participation and Achievement: Tamalpa Runners of Marin County.  
All the Tamalpans accomplished in 2004 was nine team championships in the three Grand Prix 
(three age-division crowns in each), and nine individual Grand Prix champions (five road, 
one cross-country, three ultra).  Tamalpa continues to stage popular races on each of the 
Grand Prix circuits, and can also boast the repeat winner of ultrarunning's Volunteer of 
the Year award, Gary Wang.
 
All those who enjoyed the luncheon at Wente Vineyards can thank especially Carola Laue, 
the principal organizer (and race director of the Skyline 50K), as well as an extensive 
list of generous sponsors, headed by Pacific Striders and including also several PA clubs 
and races: Buffalo Chips,  Quicksilver RC, Tamalpa Runners, Quadruple Dipsea, MiWok 100K, 
American River 50M, Ohlone Wilderness 50K, Skyline 50K, and the Western States 100M.  The 
latter's race director, Greg Soderlund, served as the event's emcee.

<h3>2005 U.S. World Cup 100Km Team Named</h3></div>
<div>The Mountain/Ultra/Trail (MUT) Council of USA Track &amp; Field has selected the USA 100 Km Team to compete in the 2005 IAU 100km World Cup. The USATF 100K National Team will compete in the 2005 International Association of Ultrarunners (IAU) 100 Km World Cup under the Patronage of the IAAF in Lake Saroma, Hokkaido, Japan on June 26, 2005. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The annual 100 Km World Cup race is the international venue at which USATF fields an ultra distance team. The United States will be represented by a team of six men and six women ultrarunners. The 62.1 mile World Cup road race is one of two ultra distance events that has achieved international prominence under the auspices of the International Association of Ultrarunners. Another event, the I.A.U. 24 Hours World Challenge, will be held this July in Worschach, Austria and in 2006 will be staged in Taipei, Taiwan. A U.S. team will also compete at this event. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The 2005 U.S. team members for the 100km World Cup are: </div>
<pre><font size="2"><u><strong><font size="3">Women</font></strong></u>
Anne Riddle Lundblad, 38 Asheville, NC

Scott Creel, 42, Bozeman, MT
Jarrow Wahman, 43, Duluth, MN
Bob Sweeney, 38, Rye Brook, NY
Brad Lael, 40, Carmichael, CA</font>
</pre>
<div>The athletes selected by USATF/MUT comprise the officially sanctioned team from the United States participating in IAU World Cup 100 Km competition. Howard Nippert and Anne Riddle were automatically selected to the team based on their top ten finishes at the World 100km in 2004. MUT selected the remaining team members and alternates for the US National 100 Km Team based on their ultrarunning performances that met the published criteria during the qualifying period. Some of the aforementioned athletes may decline their spot based on training plans, injury, or other commitments with family and work. Each athlete must be a current USATF member to compete in this event for the U.S. national team. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The team receives limited funding and most athletes must pay for a large portion of their expenses out of their own pockets. There is a non-profit organization, Ultrarunners Supporting Ultrarunners (USU) and this organization has raised funds for the team for a number of years. Donations are always welcome. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Managers of this yea's team include Minnesota resident Lin Gentling who has been a competitor on the team in the past as well as manager in 1993 to1997, 1999, 2001 to 2004, first year manager in an official capacity Tim Yanacheck, WI, who has been on numerous 100km World Cup trips as a handler for athletes, and Lion Caldwell, NM who will serve as the team doctor. Caldwell traveled with the team from 1995 to 2004 and is also a seasoned ultra distance competitor. </div>

<hr> The PA was well represented at Team Club Nationals this past 
weekend.  The glaring absence was out of all the strong Senior and 
Super-Senior Etc. clubs, only Excelsior was able to muster a team 
comprised of over-50-runner's.  (Tom K. raced for the Ags and the 
Fleet Feet team used seniors for several places in the 40-49 Master 
Division.

Results
Open Men
Farm Team a strong first followed closely by the Aggies impressive 
squad in third.  Transport Addidas represented two top-20ish teams 
at 7th and 21st, followed by WVTC at 28th and Empire in 38th.  The 
conditions were epicly muddy and deteriorating rapidly as the day 
progressed. 41 total teams.

Master Men
Excelsior was beat by the Lo Cal (All-Stars) Team Runners High by 
just over 2:00 for second, the Aggies were third; our injury 
depleted team was 16th (15th if they had used me in place of our 5th 
runner) Fleet Feet was 17th with the afore-mentioned Senior laced 
team. 18 total teams.

Open Women
Farm Team was narrowly beaten by See Jane Run (0:03.72) four 
seconds!, with the Aggie girls in at 7th; The Impalas scored two 
teams in 9th and 23rd, followed by WVTC at 20th and Fleet Feet Sac 
at 22nd. 23 total teams.

Master Women
Impalas were 4th in a deep race, followed by the Fleet Feet women in 
7th of 9 teams scoring.

Seniors
Excelsior was narrowly pushed to 2nd of 5 by a strong team out of 
Boulder, 40 seconds or so. The Boulder club resembles the Tamalpa 
club, or local to Sac the Buffalo Chips, in that they seem to get 
more competitive in the older age divisions.

A unique note, I hail from an IIAC school (Iowa Intercollegiate 
Athletic Conference) which boasted 1st Open Woman and 5th Open Man 
(Wartburg College out of Waverly Iowa, Go Nights!  The guy is two 
time NCAA Division III Champion, not sure about his fairer 
colleague. These two athletes are Melissa Buttry and Josh Moen.

<a name="GG"></a>
<big><b>Course changed for Cross Country Championships</b></big>
<br>
<i>(posted 11/16/2004)</i>
<br>
Dear Cross Country friends,
 
Here is the revised <a href="/data/2004/XCMapGGP.pdf">course map</a> for this Sunday's Pacific Association Cross Country 
Championships.  The start is basically moved west about a quarter of a mile, to start 
not in Lindley Meadow, but in the Polo Fields.
 
Due to an error by SF Rec and Parks, Lindley Meadow was reseeded this week and can 
not be used for any part of our annual championships.  The new course uses the basic 
loop we are all familiar with, the start and finish are in different places-- to the 
west of our usual stomping grounds.  We are confident the new start and finish will 
result in a great race, like usual. 
 
Start-- on the Polo Fields at the extreme west end.  Enter through the north tunnel, 
registration and packet pickup will be immediately to the north of the tunnel.  Park 
nearer Spreckle's Lake and where 36th Avenue comes into the park than the usual site 
at Lindley Meadow and where 30th Avenue comes into GG Park and meets Kennedy Drive.  
Go into the road that goes into the stables, but instead of going right to the police 
stables and the vacant public stables, keep left on the road--it seems more like 
straight ahead--and go back a hundred yards or so to the tunnel.  
 
Finish-- it's on the dirt trotting track behind the north bleachers.  On the last lap 
you come from behind the trail behind the bushes along the north side of the polo 
fields and sprint like mad for 100 meters to the finish.  End of the chute is pretty 
close to being over the tunnel, you are running west to east.
 
Basic loop- most of it is very familiar to long time runners on the course.  Changes 
from last year:  instead of going into Lindley Meadow on the grass, you stay up on 
the dirt path along Kennedy Drive the length of the meadow.  Instead of running from 
west to east on the dirt trotting track after going up the steep hill at the west end 
of the polo fields (and jumping over a log at the top of the hill), we will turn 
before the log and run outside the trees along the west and north parks of the polo 
fields.  This is what we did to avoid the Dave Mathews band excitement in September.  
We used it for years, only went to the dirt path when the horse coral near Lindley 
was disturbed by runners racing by...(it wasn't so funny, some kids were bucked off 
during an overly enthusiastic HS race, it wasn't us). 
 
You can make it easier for race administration by registering online at <a href="http://www.active.com/event_detail.cfm?event_id=1177326">www.active.com</a>
We welcome race day reg ($20, cash or check), but with the changes required for the 
altered course, online reg would be appreciated.  Online registration has been 
extended at the $15 price to November 18th, this Thursday evening at midnight.
 
See you at the races,

<br>
<b><big>2005 Wall Calendar Ready for Release October 12</big></b> MONTEREY, Calif. - (October 6, 2004) - The 2005 wall calendar "Strength 
and Grace: Monterey Bay Women Athletes" is not for the faint of heart. 
The calendar, however, is for anyone who appreciates the elegance and 
beauty of the athletic human form.
 
"Strength and Grace: Monterey Bay Women Athletes" will be officially 
released on Tuesday, October 12 in Carmel, CA (see media advisory below) 
as a fundraising project for the Team USA Monterey Bay Distance Running 
Training Center at California State University, Monterey Bay.
 
The calendar, which has a retail value of $20, is offered as a 
complimentary gift for Team USA Monterey Bay supporters who make a 
minimum tax-deductible donation of $25 to the non-profit organization. 
All donations are used to directly support Team USA Monterey Bay's 
mission to develop U.S. stars in the sport of long distance running and 
to provide athlete role models in the general community who promote 
physical fitness and healthy lifestyles.
 
The 2005 wall calendar contains photos of 13 local female athletes, ages 
20 to 60, who posed "au naturelle" for photographer Helen MacKinlay's 
camera in support of Team USA Monterey Bay. The black and white images 
emphasize the beauty of line and form of the athletes who remain 
anonymous in the calendar. The project is MacKinlay's follow-up work to 
her 2004 calendar, "The Full Monterey: Sexagenarian Male Athletes," which 
contains photos of male athletes age 60 and over. The 2004 version 
brought in over $4,000 in donations for the running center. MacKinlay's 
husband, Rod MacKinlay, who sits on Team USA Monterey Bay's Board of 
Directors, helped produce both calendars.
 
The unveiling of the 2005 calendar is part of Team USA Monterey Bay's 
fall fundraising drive during which the charity organization hopes to 
raise $25,000, almost a quarter of its annual operating budget. The 
center in Monterey at CSUMB, which currently supports five full-time 
resident athletes, is affiliated with USA Track &amp; Field (the sport's 
national federation), but depends upon funding from individual and 
corporate donors and sponsors. It is one of six similar long distance 
training centers for American elite and emerging elite distance runners 
around the country.
 
In variations of the skin-revealing theme popularized by the English 
housewives depicted in the popular film Calendar Girls, elite female high 
jumpers and pole vaulters have uncovered themselves for wall calendars 
promoting their causes. The women featured in "Strength and Grace: 
Monterey Bay Women Athletes," however, are not professional, full-time 
athletes. They are everyday recreational sports participants and fitness 
enthusiasts--runners, walkers, cyclists, and swimmers--who find 
satisfaction, purpose, and a joyful spirit inside a sound body.
 
"I work out daily and believe in the importance of physical fitness," 
said Jiraphon Garrard of Monterey who is one of the calendar models. 
"Posing for the calendar gives me an opportunity to support and help 
promote Team USA Monterey Bay's athletes and the kids running programs 
they're involved with in local schools."
 
Said photographer MacKinlay, "I believe strongly in physical fitness, 
and, as a photographer, I appreciate the sensual energy of the body's 
line and form which I try to capture in my work."
 
MacKinlay has photographed the human figure for 20 years. She has 
exhibitions and credits in many cities worldwide, and has published a 
book of nude images in black and white.
 
Individuals may obtain the 2005 calendar by making a donation of $25 or 
more using the downloadable donation form on Team USA Monterey Bay's web 
site at csumb.edu/teamusa. Donors may deduct the portion of their 
contribution above the $20 value of the calendar (always consult your tax 
advisor).
 
Calendar enthusiasts can also obtain copies, personally signed by the 
models and photographer, at the official calendar launch on October 12 
(see details below). Team USA Monterey Bay's athletes will also be 
present at the launch where Bob Sevene, the team's head coach, will 
present roses to each of the calendar models.
 
In addition, the calendar will be available after the official launch at 
the following locations: Big Sur Half Marathon Expo, (October 16, 
Monterey Convention Center), The Treadmill (Carmel Crossroads Shopping 
Center), Carmel Crimpers (Su Vecino, Carmel), Fleet Feet (Monterey, Del 
Monte Shopping Center), and Phrasemaker Word Processing/Resume Services 
(Main Street, Los Altos).

<h3>Heritage Oaks Bank 10K Report</h3> <i>(posted 9/27/2004)</i>
<br> Simonaitis, Lagunas Win USA Masters Titles at Heritage Oaks Bank 10K
By Mark Winitz, Running USA wire
 
PASO ROBLES, Calif. - (Sept. 26, 2004) - On December 22, 2003 
earthquake waves rolled through Paso Robles, a thriving community that 
sprang up in the 1880s exactly halfway between San Francisco and Los 
Angeles. The 6.5 quake on the Richter Scale destroyed 82 historic 
buildings and killed two people in the downtown square where the town's 
annual Heritage Oaks Banks Fun Day road races start and finish.
 
On Sunday morning, waves of runners soothed painful memories and 
celebrated a dramatic revitalization of Paso Robles by filling its 
streets for road races that included the USA Masters 10K Championship.
 
Dennis Simonaitis, 42, of Draper, UT emerged as the U.S. master 
men's 10K champion, negotiating the flat and fast two loop course in 30 
minutes and 24 seconds. Rosemarie Lagunas, 42, of San Jose, CA captured 
the women's title in 36:19. Both scored convincing victories, trouncing 
their respective fields.
 
Simonaitis used perfect racing conditions in the low 50s to avenge 
last year's second-place performance to rival Eddy Hellebuyck. Brian 
Pope, 41, of Oxford, MS placed second, well behind Simonaitis in 30:47. 
Hellebuyck, 43, of Albuquerque, NM was third, over two minutes slower 
than his national masters record of 29:05 set in this race in 2003. 
Hellebuyck, who holds multiple U.S. masters records, competed despite an 
out-of-competition positive drug test for erythropoietin (EPO) last 
January that he is contesting.
 
Taking an early lead, Simonaitis fronted a large pack that whittled 
to about six contenders by the 5K, hit in 15:21. His lead was tenuous, 
however, since one shoe became untied two miles into the race.
 
"That's never happened to me before," said Simonaitis about the 
misstep, "So I was running a little gingerly. But otherwise I felt good. 
I wanted to push it a little bit through halfway and not leave it to the 
end. Some of those guys have good kicks. I felt in control pretty much 
all the way through."
 
Indeed, Simonaitis gradually increased the tempo over the last 
several miles, leaving his contenders far in his wake. He improved his 
time by almost 30 seconds over the 2003 race, which was also run in ideal 
conditions.
 
Said Hellebuyck: "This was my first race in eight months, so I'm 
trying to get the intensity back. I've been training, but it's not the 
same as racing. I hope to get this [drug] situation behind me and start 
focusing on racing again."
 
For Lagunas, the masters women's victory came a bit as a surprise. 
Although she qualified for the 2000 U.S. Women's Olympic Marathon Trials, 
and has been competing since she was 14-years-old, she rarely appears on 
the roads. This fall, Lagunas is concentrating on cross country races.
 
"I haven't run a 10K in a million years, and I didn't know if I was 
going to die," admitted Lagunas, who led the entire race. "I thought just 
let's wait and see what happens. But then I still felt really good after 
the first loop, and thought that it was a good sign. I said 'Let's just 
pick it up at mile four and see what happens.'"
 
That strategy left long-time standout marathoner Maria Trujillo de 
Rios and Sarah Kramer to contend for runner-up spots. Kramer, 44, of 
Ogden, UT overtook De Rios, 44, of Los Gatos, CA in the second mile and 
proceeded to a second place finish of 36:54. De Rios was third in 37:22.
 
53-year-old Kathryn Martin (Northport, NY) ran a superb 37:32 which 
gave her the top female age-graded performance (a 32:23 age-adjusted 
time). Antoni Niemczak, (48, Albuquerque, NM), competing in his first 
race in several years, notched the best men's age-graded mark. His 
fourth-place 31:09 finish converted to a 28:24 age-adjusted time.
 
In the separate California 10K Championship race for competitors 
under 40 years old, Kenyans Eric Chirchir and Wilson Kigen crossed the 
finish in a virtual tie. Chirchir was awarded the victory by USATF finish 
line judges. Both men were timed in 29:18. Ethiopia's Atalelech Ketema 
successfully defended her women's title in an unchallenged 33:39. 
Christian Hesch (7th, 30:04, Morro Bay) and Megan Daly (2nd, 35:06, Palo 
Alto) were the first California finishers and were also crowned Pacific 
Association/USATF Open 10K Champions.
 
Heritage Oaks Bank awarded $56,000 in prize earnings of which over 
half is devoted to masters runners, and $8,000 to the accompanying 
Pacific Association/USATF Championship. All proceeds generated from the 
event's entry fees are distributed to local non-profit organizations. 
Through 2003, these donations totaled nearly $70,000.

<h3>Movie on US elite distance runners coming out</h3> <i>(posted 9/8/2004)</i>
<br>
September 8, 2004 
<h2>Five Thousand Meters: Nothing Comes Easy heads into post-production</h2> COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (September 8, 2004)- Fans of American distance
running will soon get to know their heroes a little better. Negative
Split Pictures (NSP) is proud to announce that their first feature film,
<b>Five Thousand Meters: Nothing Comes Easy</b> has entered post-production.
 
The first film of its kind, Five Thousand Meters: Nothing Comes Easy
follows the top 5k runners in the country as they prepare for the Olympic
Trials and their shot at the Olympic team. 
 
The all-star cast of runners includes <b>Tim Broe, Jonathon Riley, Bolota
Asmerom, Matt Lane, and Mark Menefee</b> - the top five runners at the Olympic
Trials in July. Also featured are <b>Adam Goucher, Jorge Torres, Ryan Bak,
and Dathan Ritzenhein</b>.
 
"The mix of athletes in the project is what makes it great," said director
Brennan Galloway. "You have some runners just hoping to make it to the
Trials, some runners who are there to win, some runners really struggling
with injuries and the mental aspect of running. Together they do a good
job of really showing what running on the elite level in America is all
about."
 
From the Mt. Sac Invitational in April through the Olympic Trials in July,
Five Thousand Meters: Nothing Comes Easy chronicles the hard work,
injuries, doubts, breakthroughs, and success of the runners.
 
Shot on location with the <b>Nike Farm Team, Team USA Monterey Bay</b>, the
Hansons-Brooks Distance Project, Mark Wetmore's training group in Boulder,
and Ron Warhurst's runners in Ann Arbor, the film covers the hotspots of
American distance running.
 
"We were really fortunate that we were able to feature the athletes that
we wanted," said Carl Leivers, the producer behind the film. "All of the
top 5k guys in the country are in the film which makes it more about the
race to make the team than about any particular runner."
 
The film is more than simply a video training log, however. Thanks to
unprecedented access to the athletes and coaches, Five Thousand Meters:
Nothing Comes Easy will take the viewer inside the lives of those
struggling to make the Olympic Team.
 
In-depth interviews with the runners and their coaches make the film a
personal chronicle of the Olympic dream and of finding the limits of
personal performance.
 
"I think this really fills a need in the running community," said
Galloway. "There just isn't much coverage of American distance running
and people really don't know much about these runners as people. I think
this film will let them get closer than ever before."
 
Five Thousand Meters: Nothing Comes Easy is scheduled for a Fall 2004
release.

<h3>San Francisco Chronicle Marathon Expands Cool Reputation</h3> <font size="2"><i>(posted 6/20/2004 </i></font><i>from Running USA wire)</i>
<br> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> Contact:
Mark Winitz, Media Coordinator, (650) 948-0618, winitz@earthlink.net
Peter Nantell, Event Producer, (415) 291-9990, 
peter_nantell@westendmanagement.com
 
SAN FRANCISCO - (June 18, 2004) - The San Francisco Chronicle 
Marathon, scheduled for Sunday, August 1, will present its 27th annual 
running less than a month before the 2004 Olympic Games marathons. Unlike 
Athens, however, competitors won't tackle hot and smoggy conditions. 
Instead, upwards of 7,000 runners will descend on the city about which 
Mark Twain never actually wrote: the coldest winter I ever spent was a 
summer in San Francisco. Regardless of the quote's source, runners from 
all over the world flock to the City by the Bay for the coolest 
mid-summer marathon in the U.S. The average starting line temperature for 
the race over the last five years is a perfect (for marathoners) 56 
degrees Fahrenheit.
 
The 2004 event is on track for more cool stuff that event producer 
Peter Nantell of West End Management hopes will help the event exceed the 
record 8,000 participants that turned out exactly 20 years ago in another 
Olympic year, 1984. To date, entries are up 50 percent from last year 
when a steadily climbing 5,000 participants finished the San Francisco 
Chronicle Marathon, associated two half marathons, 4-person marathon 
relay and 5-kilometer run/walk.
 
"The race finally clicked two years ago when we changed the 
course," said Nantell. "Last year the race grew by about 25 percent 
strictly on the word of mouth. So, I think this is a natural outgrowth."
 
In 2002, the marathon changed its course from a loop that started 
and finished in Golden Gate Park to a route that begins and ends at San 
Francisco's downtown jewel - on the historic Embarcadero within 100 yards 
of both Justin Herman Plaza and the recently restored Ferry Building 
Marketplace and Farmer's Market. Today's race participants now find a 
large staging area that holds a growing field, plentiful public 
transportation to the start where there is abundant public parking and a 
finish after which runners can kick back and enjoy the colorful heart of 
San Francisco.
 
"Being downtown gives a lot more energy to the event, and it's 
convenient," said Nantell. "You don't need to be bussed out or back. You 
can walk to the start from your hotel. It's easy for spectators to get 
to. Everything associated with the event - for example, the start, 
finish, race expo and pasta feed - are all within easy walking distance 
of each other."
 
The 26.2-mile marathon race course features many of San Francisco's 
scenic landmarks such as Fisherman's Wharf, Golden Gate Park and Presidio 
National Park; offers views of the Golden Gate Bridge and Alcatraz 
Island; and takes runners along both San Francisco Bay and the Pacific 
Ocean, through the Haight-Ashbury District and past baseball's SBC Park 
(home of the Giants) before finishing in front of the Ferry Building at 
the city's thriving world trade port.
 
"Our plans for this year's marathon have exceeded our 
expectations," said Race Director Miranda Lindl. "The community of San 
Francisco and the Bay Area have become even more involved. Local running 
clubs, sports retailers and the general running community are providing 
overwhelming support."
 
Lindl mentions that this support translates to more services and 
entertainment value for participants. Volunteers from national embassies 
and consulates dressed in traditional country attire will staff course 
aid stations. Music and dance groups, plus community-sponsored "Walls of 
Noise" will greet and motivate runners in route.
 
Individuals not able or inclined to run a full marathon or who want 
to cover the full marathon at a more leisurely pace, have numerous 
options. Last year, the event introduced a new and unique "Choose a 
Half-Marathon" format, which is a popular alternative for runners aiming 
for the 13.1 mile half-marathon distance while choosing the portion of 
San Francisco they prefer to cover. The first half-marathon (0 miles to 
13.1 miles) starts at 7:00 a.m. (the same time as the marathon) and 
follows the first portion of the Chronicle Marathon course. The second 
half-marathon (13.1 miles to 26.2 miles) starts at 8:45 a.m. and follows 
the second portion of the marathon course.
 
Plus, for the first time, both the marathon and first half-marathon 
have a 5 a.m. early start option for slower runners. Thus, full course 
amenities for marathon runners are expanded from 5 hours to 7 hours. This 
allows for a full 7-hour marathon running pace time with complete course 
and post-event support.
 
Additional race alternatives include the Marathon Relay which 
consists of 4-person relay teams that cover the entire marathon route, 5K 
Run/Walk and Progressive Marathon in which participants run or walk 26.2 
miles incrementally over a period of weeks or months and complete the 
final part of their cumulative marathon by participating in the 5K 
Run/Walk on race day. The marathon's unique "Cause to Run" program allows 
participants to pledge support to any of the event's official charity 
organizations, raise funds and earn pledge prizes by participating in any 
of the running/walking events. Last year, race participants raised over 
$110,000 for local charities that provide valuable and much-needed 
services for the community.
 
Finally, race weekend also includes the 2004 Healthy Living Expo, 
Friday and Saturday, July 30-31 at Justin Herman Plaza which features 
over 80 exhibitors, and running and fitness seminars at the nearby Hyatt 
Regency hotel.

<h3>Wednesday Night Laundry Runners Club in the News</h3> (posted 5/25/2004, from Running USA wire)

Wednesday Night Laundry Runners Club, Big Sur Marathon Award Scholarships

MONTEREY, Calif. - (May 24, 2004) - The Monterey Bay Wednesday Night Laundry Runners Club (WNLR) has 
selected three outstanding Monterey County High School Senior Distance Runners for their college scholarship 
awards in 2004. Omar Mendoza of Salinas High School, Athena Pierre of Monterey High School and Jose Garcia 
of North Monterey County High School, will be this year's recipients.

Each student will receive $1,425, which was donated by The Monterey Bay Wednesday Night Laundry Runners
