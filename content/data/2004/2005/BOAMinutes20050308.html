2006 NATIONAL FALL XC CHAMPIONSHIPS 
- Peanut Harms and Aggies with Tim Wason won the bid to hold 2006 XC Champs at Golden Gate Park
- Limited discussion continues about bidding for 2007 and 2008; 2007 probably will go to East coast

with convention being in Reno.

2005 SERVICE AND LIFETIME AWARDS

NEW BUSINESS
- PA Masters T&F Championships Meet: Don Rose cannot do it but will donate awards. Need the meet to maintain 
USATF compliance. Meet can generate $5,000 in revenue. Motion unanimously passed that the PA offer a free 
sanction if necessary and up to $1000 for cost of venue to assist club/director in holding PA Masters T&F 
Championships Meet:
- PA Surplus Funds: This money could be used to improve the sport in the area. Strategic planning session 
is needed to look at the big picture. Send  ideas to develop a "new activity" to the Board of Directors or 
to Executive Director. Current possibilities include the Golden West Invitational (may not cost us anything), 
an Indoor T&F National meet at Reno's new indoor track that would include subsidies to bring world class open 
and youth athletes. Need a decision about the minimum amount of money to be kept in reserve. August 27 or 28 
is a possible date for strategic planning session.

COMMITTEE REPORTS
- Membership, Irene Herman - 2216 total; lost around 40 masters t&f athletes to SoCal.
- Youth, Joanne-Slaton Camargo - meeting with Central went well indicating good cooperation in future 
activities. SLO youth want to join Central due to Bakersfield competions - this is not a problem. Central 
wants to bid on 2008 July 4 Youth Nationals - PA could help with this if we don't get the trials. Central 
is also considering 2009 JO XC Championships. Merging the two associations is still a possibility.
- Officials, Dick Connors - Recertification is ongoing. NCAAs have 80-90 PA officials out of the 110. Lots 
of help with teaching is coming from Race Walk and LDR. Jim Hume is working on issuing the new certification 
numbers; use 2004 numbers in the meantime and if a problem arises verification can come from George Kleeman.
- Race Walk, Art Klein: 50-Plus Festival at Stanford will have an unjudged 5K for all ages and race walk 
clinics.
- Disabled Athletes - Charlie Sheppard: Meet scheduled for May 20 at San Jose City Track. PA was asked if 
interested in hosting qualifier for European Champs - requires more officials.
- LDR, Tyler Abbott: LDR banquet at Wente Vineyards was a success with 74 awards presented and an excellent 
speaker.
- Media, Fred Baer: T&F writers luncheon March 22 in Foster City; Comcast Sportsnet w/Bob Fraley will cover 
Fresno Relays and Cal/Nevada meet.
- Coaches, Dave Shrock - Eight successful clinics held to date; Dave has a coach email list that includes 
youth, HS, colleges - if used be sure to "blind cc" it. There is also a CD-ROM of national coaches referred 
to as "Craig's List."
- Open Track & Field, Jerry Colman: Grand Prix has begun with first meet at Stanford. $15,000 season prize 
money offered for both men and women.
