PA LDR Meeting
March 20, 2005, San Francisco, near Across the Bay 12K finish

Call to order approximately 10:10 am.

Minutes from Cal 10 meeting 1/10/2005 unanimously approved.

No reports from Ultra or Sponsorship/Fundraising subcommittees

A report showing the cross country bids received was presented by the
Cross Country Subcommittee. The following races were unanimously approved
as listed on the report:
     9/3 Empire
     9/10 Golden Gate Park
     10/1 Presidio
     10/22 Shoreline
     10/29 Tamalpa
     11/6 PA Champs

The subcommittee reported that the Santa Cruz race had not bid, and that
Crystal Springs and the Asics Aggie Challenge in Folsom had both bid for
10/8. Without a specific vote, there was a consensus that Crystal Springs
would probably get preference for the date because (a) the Asics Aggies
already had another race on the circuit; and (b) the Folsom course is
still in flux. The final decision should be made at the following meeting,
but in the meantime the clubs involved were asked to consider the
situation and see if they could come up with any non-conflicting solutions.

Bay Area Ultra Runners, hosts of the LDR Banquet, were thanked for their
efforts. The committee accepted an offer from the Impalas to host the 2006
banquet (for 2005 awards).

Motion to approve Stephanie Banbury (replacing Ruth Anderson) and Kim
Rupert (vacant slot) as women's LDR and masters' LDR, respectively,
members of the Board of Athletics passed unanimously.

Motion to approve Linda Hall and Kristian Peterson as LDR co-secretaries
passed unanimously.

RULES CHANGES

      Motion to drop one race in the long grand prix unanimously postponed
to next meeting.

      Motion to limit number of races in Road Grand Prix to 12; even up
number of
races in each (short/long) grand prix to 6/6, possibly having one 10K in
each {Trimble} postponed from prior meeting brought to floor. Don Porteous
proposed an amendment to limit the total number of races in the road grand
prix to 14 plus relay; score only five races in each (short and long
individual) grand prix; and to have teams drop two races. Both amendment
and main motion postponed to next meeting by unanimous vote.

      Motion (below) to revise the comp entry "drop-downs" {Trimble}
defeated unanimously.
         Change Rule 16.2:   Comp entries will be given to the top 15 open
runners, regardless of age.   The top 10 masters not included in the
open comps will also receive comps.  The top 5 seniors, not included in
the masters and open, will receive comps.  The top 3 super-seniors,
not included in open/master/senior comps will receive comps.  The top
veteran not included in the open/masters/seniors/super-seniors comps will
receive a comp.

      Motion (below) to revise comp entry minimum races {Trimble} defeated
12-2.
         Change Rule 16.4:   In the Road grand prix, in order to be
eligible for comped entries, an athlete must have competed in at least 51%
of the races in the series on which the comps are based. If a runner is
ineligible for failing to meet this requirement, the next eligible runner
shall receive the comped entries.

      Motion (below) made to determine comp entries for relay events.
      Add new section 16.5: In relay events, there are no individual
comps, but teams who received money in the prior year's grand prix shall
receive complimentary entries.
Motion amended unanimously to read, "In relay events, there are no
individual comps, but a team that won its age
division in the prior year's grand prix shall receive one complimentary
entry." Amended motion passed, 12-2.

      Motion to add new 12.2(e): "Under any circumstances a runner may
only score
once for one team at each event in any grand prix" postponed to next
meeting. Author (Abbott) was instructed to rewrite the
motion to more clearly reflect the proposal at the prior meeting. {Revised
language: "Team members in a relay event are limited to scoring only
one leg for that team, and to scoring on only one team."}

2005 Road Grand Prix schedule
     CIM has decided not to bid.
     Christmas Relays date has been tentatively set to 12/11 {since the
meeting this date has been finalized}
     NorCal 10 Miler. Race director asked if we would likely accept the
race if he moved it back one week. General consensus was that that would
put it too close (one week) from the Across the Bay 12K, but if he wanted
to move it one week EARLIER, that would be acceptable.
