RULE CHANGES
Proposal:  Increase cross country prize money: (Stephenson)  Lloyd
Stephenson proposed changing Cross Country Rule #7 to increase the minimum
prize funds to $2000 for the Championship and to keep all other races at
$1500.  Following an extensive discussion about entry fees, points and
prize money, Stephenson withdrew the motion. <br>
<br>
Scoresheet Integrity (Preston): Dan Preston discussed the ongoing problems
with score sheet submissions, the lack of a grace period for submissions,
drop down scoring, and continuing numerous appeals.  Specifically, there
have at this point been many documented examples of submitted scoresheets
never ariving at the destination, which has made for a high level of
appeals. <br>
<br>
Proposal:  Online scoring listing.  Abbott proposed allowing the scorers
to maintain an online yes/no type listing to show what teams have
submitted scoresheets.  Following discussion, this motion was seconded and
approved by unanimous vote.
<br>
Scoring Grace Period:  Preston proposed a two business day grace period
for submitting results, after friendly amendments.  During this time only
automatic dropping down will be allowed, exact language to be determined
by the chairs (see Appendix A).  This motion was seconded and unanimously
approved. <br>  
<br>
NEW BUSINESS: <br>
2006 Road Grand Prix Schedule:  Several changes in the 2006 Road Race
Grand Prix were discussed.  LSI Logic Race originally slated as a 5K in
April has dropped out.  This has opened up a slot in the series.  A new
bid was submitted by the Buffalo Chips for the Susan B. Anthony women’s
only 5k race to be held in Sacramento on August 12.  It would be a double
point race for women only with $2600 prize money.  It was moved and
seconded to add this race to the Grand Prix series.  The vote was: 12 in
favor, 1 opposed, 1 abstention.  Thus, the motion passed. <br>
<br>
The Applied Materials 5k race scheduled for Thanksgiving Day (Nov 23,
2006) was discussed to answer questions that were raised in the last
meeting.  Mark Winitz handed out the press release from the 2005 race.  It
was very successful with about 1800 participants.  There were two separate
starts, one being for elite athletes.  The course is a half mile loop
which is completed 6 times for the 5k.  Their bid was reviewed in
September and implicitly rejected due to the grand prix already having the
maximum number of races. They pledge $5200 to be dedicated to PAUSATF
athletes with $9000 open to all comers. It was proposed and seconded that
this race be scored for open men only, with a $2600 prize purse, pending
approval by the race management. The vote was 5 in favor, 1 opposed, 4
abstentions. Thus, this motion passed. [After the meeting the race
management approved the offer, and the LDR Executive Committee voted to
make it a double point race and to allow only open and masters runners on
the short grand prix comp list to be comped.] <br>
<br>
PA Championship Scoring:  A motion was made that, in races where teams are
declared, the team declaration should be allowed as the score sheet. This
proposal was made into a motion which was seconded.  The vote was 2 in
favor, 5 opposed and 1 abstention.  Therefore this motion failed.  It will
still be necessary to submit a separate scoresheet even if teams are
declared in advance. <br> 
<br>
APPEALS:  The following appeals were discussed and voted on:
Spartan senior men at Folsom, Shoreline:  Results were claimed to have
been submitted but did not get registered.  A motion to approve was made
and seconded.  The motion passed unanimously. <br>
<br>
Adidas Transports open women at Clarksburg.  Results were claimed to have
been submitted (with corroborating contemporaneous email evidence) to the
regular scorer on Monday November 14, but did not get posted.  A motion to
approve was made and seconded.  The motion passed unanimously. <br>
<br>
Adidas Transports open women at PA championships: The team did not know
that it had to submit a scoresheet because it had declared its team in
advance of the race. Following a discussion a motion to approve was made
and seconded.  The results were:  6 in favor of accepting the appeal, 1
opposed, 1 abstention.  This appeal passed. <br>
<br>
Farm Team open men and women at PA championships:  The person in charge
did not submit a score sheet because he did not know it was necessary due
to having submitted a team declaration form before the race.  A motion to
approve was made and seconded.  The results were: 7 in favor of accepting
the appeal, 4 opposed, 2 abstentions.  This appeal passed. <br>
<br>
National Rule on Non-Resident Athletes (Mark Winitz):  USATF Regulation 7
(Representation) concerning the eligibility of non-resident athletes for
association clubs was amended at the 2005 USATF National Convention.  The
amendment allows the national sport committees to establish requirements
related to representation and eligibility for team scoring in national and
regional championships.

At the convention, the national LDR committees established these
requirements based on a draft submittal by the PA/USATF representatives on
these committees (Irene Herman, Lloyd Stephenson, Mark Winitz).  These
requirements foster locally cohesive association clubs.  A discussion
ensued regarding the implementation of these requirements in the Pacific
Association.  The PA/USATF LDR Committee decided to continue discussion at
the next meeting.
<br>
<br>
Cross Country Appeals Period:  Dan Preston explained and compared the
submission, grace period and appeals process for Road Races versus Cross
Country.  To clarify the situation with Cross Country scoring, a motion
was made that the 10-day protest period will automatically follow the
expiration of the just-approved two business day grace period following
the posting of results, and the LDR Executive Committee shall adjudicate
any protests as soon as possible. An amendment was proposed that the
10-day protest period will begin with the broadcasting of an email to the
club list stating that results have been posted, which email will be sent
as soon as possible after the expiration of the grace period. The
amendment was seconded and passed with a vote of 6 in favor, 2 opposed,
and 3 abstentions. Following approval of the amendment, the main motion
was approved with a vote of 14 in favor and 1 abstention. <br>
<br>
RAC results-Record Keeping:  There was a discussion of the ongoing problem
that races are not submitting post race results.  For the 2005 Grand Prix
road series only two races have submitted results.  Such records must be
signed by the referee, the Race Director and the Timing company.  A
suggestion was made that when a group bids on a race, they should be sent
a set of instructions on how to submit results.  The implication is that
if the results are not submitted, our PAUSATF athletes will not get credit
for their performances.  USATF will no longer be keeping single age group
records, but they are keeping age group records. <br>  
<br>
The next meeting will be held following the Emerald Across the Bay 12k
race on March 19, 2006. <br>
<br>
The meeting was adjourned at approximately 1:15. <br>
<br>_____________
APPENDIX A: Scoring Grace Period Rule<br>
<br>
New Section 18.2:
18.2 In order for a club team to be eligible for scoring at a
championship, team score sheets must be submitted by email to the official
scorer no later than the Wednesday following the race. Team leaders are
strongly encouraged to use the scoresheet form available on the
appropriate page (road or cross country) of the Pacific Association
website, www.pausatf.org; this scoresheet automatically sends an email to
the official scorer. The name of each team member, including non-scoring
members, should be included on the scoresheets. Due to imperfections in
the scoresheet system, a team not initially scored after the Wednesday
deadline has two business days after the preliminary posting of results by
the scorer in which to submit a team which was not scored. During this
period only "automatic" drop-downs may be used, that is, a person in a
given age division will be treated as belonging to the next younger age
division if and only if (a) they did not run fast enough to score for
their team in their own age division, (b) their team in their own age
division did not have enough runners to score a full team, or (c) they
were not listed on a timely-submitted scoresheet for their own age
division. A runner dropping down a division will be treated as if they
were of the age of the lower division for that race, and so may re-apply
this rule and continue to drop down until they find a division in which
they might score. Thus a super senior could score as an open runner under
this automatic drop down rule if the person did not run fast enough to
score on his or her super senior, senior, or masters team. <br>
<br>
Old Section 18.2: <br>
18.2 In order for a club team to be eligible for scoring at a
championship, team score sheets must be submitted by email to the official
scorer no later than the Wednesday following the race. Team leaders are
strongly encouraged to use the scoresheet form available on the
appropriate page (road or cross country) of the Pacific Association
website, www.pausatf.org; this scoresheet automatically sends an email to
the official scorer. The name of each team member should be included on
the scoresheets.
