DIRECTIONS

If you are coming on I-80 you need to get off on Highway 4 and come east to  
Alhambra Ave which is at the bottom of the hill.  If you are coming on  Highway 
24 via 680 get off at Highway 4 north or south.  The south exit has  changed and 
is now about a half mile further north but is clearly marked.   Take Highway 4 
west to Alhambra Avenue.  In both cases go south on Alhambra  Avenue about 1/2 
mile to where it turns to the left at the signal.  Take  Alhambra Valley Road 
south (the only way it goes) and come out about a mile to  the 35 mph sign just 
beyond the 20 mph corner.  The sign is in front of my  house at 5104 Alhambra 
Valley Road on the right side just beyond the  intersection with Wanda Way.  
My name is on the signs on both  driveways.  You can park in the driveway or on 
the gravel area on either  side of the street.
