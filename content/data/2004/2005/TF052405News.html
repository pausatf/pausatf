<h2>The Payton Jordan US Open</h2>

Memorial Day, May 30 at noon

Cobb Track & Angell Field, Stanford

The IAAF Grant Prix II meet, a stop on the VISA Championship Series,
will feature many of the finest world and American athletes who'll be
continuing their preparation for the 2005 World Track & Field
Championships this summer in Helsinki, Finland.

The Payton Jordan U.S. Open will be televised by ESPN2 and shown on a
tape-delayed basis (7-8:30 p.m.) that evening. A free Youth Clinic
will be held at the track beginning at 10 a.m. All participants, 14
and under, will receive a general admission ticket.

The meet is named in honor of former Stanford track and field coach
Payton Jordan, who brought the 1960 U.S. Olympic Trials and the famed
1962 U.S.-U.S.S.R. track meet to Stanford.

Tickets for the Memorial Day event are $35 for reserved seating and
$15 for general admission, and can be purchased by phone at
1-800-STANFORD or in person at Stanford Athletic Department Ticket
Office, Gate 2, at Stanford Stadium.
