Rules Change Proposals
1. Add to LDR Guide 16.4: "In addition, an athlete who would
otherwise be comped may choose to decline the complimentary entries. In
this case also the next eligible runner shall receive the comped entries."
2. Add new section: "LDR Executive Committee, Email Voting. 1. The
LDR Executive Committee shall consist of the LDR chairs, the cross country
subcommittee chair or chairs, the ultra subcommittee chair or chairs, the
LDR secretary, and up to three other persons selected by the LDR chairs
from clubs not otherwise represented on the committee. 2. The LDR
Executive Committee shall have the right to determine matters which would
otherwise be determined by the LDR Committee but which arise between LDR
Committee meetings and whose resolution in the judgment of the LDR chairs
cannot await the next LDR Committee meeting. 3. If in the determination of
the LDR chairs such a matter is of too great an import to be adjudicated
by the LDR Executive Committee, they may request that clubs vote by email.
Such a vote, sent to all the official club contacts, and in which each
club has the maximum number of votes to which it is entitled, has the same
force and effect as if it were made at an LDR meeting." (Recommended that
this becomes section 23 and old section 23 (Saving Clause, Other) is
renumbered 24.)
