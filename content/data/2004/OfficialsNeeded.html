* CLINIC DESCRIPTION
Has long distance running given a lot to you? Then, maybe you'd like to 
give something back!
 
Are you a runner on the mature side of the age curve that isn't as 
competitive as you once were, but still want to stay involved at the 
races? Or, perhaps, you simply want to find a productive way to volunteer 
in a great sport in a great association (Pacific).
 
Then, becoming a certified USATF Official (with an LDR specialty) might 
be right for you. There are many Pacific USATF events (Grand Prix and 
championship races) both on the roads and in cross country that can 
benefit from knowledgeable officiating. Also, officials are needed to 
help officiate long distance events in the many track meets in our 
association. And, officiating at the local association level will provide 
you with experience so you can eventually do the same at national 
championships.
 
This clinic will focus on the USATF rules that apply to long distance 
running (road running, cross country, mountain, ultra, and trail). It 
will include a written, open book rules review as a group exercise. The 
goal is to learn how to use the rulebook and find the information that 
you require--not rote memorization of the rules.
 
After successful completion of the clinic, you may chose to become 
certified as an Association Level official. If you chose this option, you 
will be asked to fill out an application for certification and become a 
member of the Pacific Association (if you're not already a member).
