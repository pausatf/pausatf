							<h2>Amandi Scotti  Returns to Sprinting &#151; after 35 years</h2>
							<div class="story" align="left">
								<p>By Bob Burns</p>

								<p>When Amanda Scotti learned that there were actually track meets for people her age &#150; with sprinting events &#150; she felt as if she had died and gone back to high school.</p>
								<p>&ldquo;The first time I put on my spikes again, I couldn&rsquo;t stop smiling,&rdquo; Scotti said. &ldquo;I love sprinting. It&rsquo;s my passion.&rdquo;</p>
								<p>&ldquo;Incredible&rdquo; is how one of her training partners describes Scotti&rsquo;s ascension on the national scene. Seventeen months after lacing up her spikes for the first time since her junior college days, Scotti, 51, is a double national champion in the 100 and 200 meters. Gone are the days when she had to rely on yoga, softball and the occasional road race to stay in shape.</p>
								<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m thrilled to have found this,&rdquo; Scotti said. &ldquo;At first I was terrified, wondering how good are these people, do I still have it, will I make a fool of myself?&rdquo;</p>
								<p>It didn&rsquo;t take long to overcome those reservations. Her teammate on the Golden West Athletics Club, Liz Palmer, immediately marveled at Scotti&rsquo;s graceful form.</p>
								<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a beautiful sprinter,&rdquo; Palmer said. &ldquo;Her stride is so fluid and graceful.&rdquo;</p>
								<p>Scotti first heard about masters track from the mother of one of her son&rsquo;s classmates. She competed in her first meet in February 2008 and won three races at the California State Senior Games in June. &nbsp;At the 2008 USA Masters Outdoor Track and Field Championships in Spokane, competing in the W50 classification, Scotti placed third in both the 400 and 100. In her third final of the four-day meet, she was leading the 200 final before collapsing to the track a few meters short of the final line.</p>
								<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure what happened,&rdquo; Scotti said. &ldquo;It probably stemmed from running so many races without enough training under my belt. I kind of redeemed myself this year.&rdquo;</p>
								<p>Sure enough, Scotti won the 100 (13.49) and 200 (28.27) at this summer&rsquo;s USA Masters event in Oshkosh, Wisc. She won the 200 by 1.33 seconds.</p>
								<p>&ldquo;This year couldn&rsquo;t have gone any better,&rdquo; Scotti said. &ldquo;I had the start of my life in the 100. In the 200, I didn&rsquo;t get a good start, but I ran a really strong turn. I love running the curve &#150; I wish tracks were round.&rdquo;</p>
								<p>Scotti competed in track at Estacada High School, located about 30 miles southeast of Portland, Ore. In 1978, she was a member of the relay teams on the Clackamas Community College team that won the National Junior College Athletic Association title.</p>
								<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t even remember my exact times,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I think I ran 26-something in the 200 and did 55s in the 400.&rdquo;</p>
								<p>When she transferred to Auburn University, she stopped competing. She settled in California and stayed active, even running a marathon at one point, but she never enjoyed distance running.</p>
								<p>&ldquo;In this area, there&rsquo;s such an emphasis on distance running,&rdquo; Scotti said. &ldquo;Fleet Feet only has shoes for distance running. It was such a delight to rediscover sprinting.&rdquo;</p>
								<p>A self-described &ldquo;stay at home&rdquo; mother of two young boys who serves on the PTA and lives in Folsom with her husband, Kevin, Amanda sells ads for National Masters News, the Orangevale-based publication. She trains at Folsom High School and American River College with a group that includes coach Elmer Haines and Palmer, a national champion in the W45 sprints and hurdles.</p>
								<p>&ldquo;To b e the national age-group champion for W50 in the 100 and 200 in only her second year of competition is incredible,&rdquo; Palmer said. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s very talented, and her enthusiasm and spirit make her a great representative of our sports.&rdquo;</p>
								<p>At first, sons Jack and Sam were impressed by their mom&rsquo;s speed and enjoyed watching her compete.</p>
								<p>&ldquo;Now it&rsquo;s, &lsquo;Do we have to go to another track meet?&rsquo;&rdquo; Amanda said.</p>
								<p>Next up on her schedule is the National Senior Games in Palo Alto, where track competition begins Aug. 5. Having taken a 30-year break from the sport, Scotti has no plan to slow down anytime soon.</p>
								<p>&ldquo;I love the competition, I love the people,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it as long as I can. Sprinters all have Type A personalities. At this age, we&rsquo;re battling not just the clock but the calendar. You&rsquo;re much more aware of what an injury can cost you at this age.&rdquo;</p>
