							<h2>Jen Hitchings 4th at 2008 USATF Womens Masters Marathon Championship</h2>
							<div class="story" align ="left">
<p><b>Jen Hitchings</b> (Buffalo Chips Running Club, Sacramento) ran in the USATF Womens Masters Marathon Championship division at Twin Cities October 5. &nbsp;She placed 4th women masters, earning a $2,500 4th place prize from USATF. &nbsp;The race conditions were very difficult, with torrential rain, strong winds and 40-45 degree weather. &nbsp;Most of the times were well off of PR and course record pace. &nbsp;For those that gutted it out and finished, it was quite an accomplishment. &nbsp;Jenny and a lot of the other women runners said they couldn&rsquo;t feel their feet at the end, and their hands were so wet and cold they could barely hold the water bottles and cups at the aid stations.<br>
									<br>
									Jenny ran a 3:01:57, well off of her 2:54 PR, but nonetheless very good under the conditions. &nbsp;She picked off several &nbsp;other women masters runners over the course of the last few miles to move up in the standings. &nbsp;In the Women&rsquo;s Open division, Silvia Skvortsov, the leader from mile 4 on, got passed by Olga Glok with only 300 yards to go, and Glok won by only 11 seconds. &nbsp;Skvortsov said she was just too cold and tight to be able to match Glok&rsquo;s finishing kick.<br>
								</p>
								<p>PA's <b>Christine Kennedy</b> was first woman in the 50-54 division, (6th, 40+ and 31st overall) in 3:03:41.</p>
