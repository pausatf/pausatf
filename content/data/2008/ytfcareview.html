								<h2>CA Track Meet Highlights</h2>
								With the outdoor season in full swing CA Track closed out its first home meet of the outdoor season. There were several performances of note from this weekend.<br>
								<br>
								East Palo Alto Greyhounds wasted no time jumping into the outdoor season as their Sub-Bantam Boys posted a meet record in the 4x100 with a time of 1:06.81. The Meet Records kept rolling when 3M Girls put out a 56.38 performance in the Bantan Girls 4x100, followed by Hoover Hawks Bantam Boys in 1:01.03 and ending the Record Breaking excitement with the Stockton Saints Open Boys 4x100 relay in a time of 47.58. <br>
								<br>
								In the Girls Race Walk The Palacio sisters (defending Junior Olympic Champions) walk their way into the Meet Record books with Caitlin Palacio in the 1500 Meter Race Walk at 9:52.50 setting a NMR. Followed by her biggger sister Chelsea Palacio who got the nod in the 3000 Meter Race Walk with a NMR of 18:54.75. <br>
								<br>
								In the Boys 80 meters Hurdles Samson Moore of Central Valley picked up the win finishing in 13.38. In addition to setting a New Meet Record the performance places Samson on top of the leaders list in the Pacific Association in that event over the previous leader Tyson Hill of LSI @ 13.7. Teammate Ariel Moore also set a NMR in the Open Girls 100 Meter Hurdles with her winning time of 18.05. <br>

								<br>
								Perhaps the performance of the meet went to Jalen Doss former AEIOU athlete who proved to be too strong for the rest of the field in the Midget Boys 400 meters as he took home the title in 59.22. Jalen also held on to win the 800 meters in 2:21.18 which makes him the associations leader in both events. <br>

The distance also qualified Arnold for the PA Outdoor T&amp;F Honor Roll list. Teammate Lorenzo-Ren Orlando opened his outdoor season with a clearance of 4-00.00 to take the Midget Boys High Jump. <br>
								<br>
								One of the more exciting events of the day came from the Parent Coaches 400 meter relay as East Palo Alto Greyhounds claimed the Men's title. <br>
								<br>
								Only a Sub-Bantam Jacob Williams, MP Striders won the 400 Meter in a time of 1:14.97 just missing the meet record by two tenths. <br>
								<br>
								The 3M Bantam Girls closed out their weekend with a victory in the 4x400 meter relay. The team of Nyela Cade, Jowhari Hill, Ashanti Johnson, Nyela Jones ran 4:38.15. <br>
								<br>
								For the most part it was a day highlighted by newcomers performing well in their Pacific Asscoiation debut, as well as returnees preparing for the season ahead. We saw plenty of action and although the calendar still reads March, we're seeing plenty of impressive marks which will make for an interesting Championship season. <br>
								<br>
								Action at the B# Sharp Track Relays continues this Saturday at 9 a.m. starting with the field events followed by the first events on the track at 9 a.m.</div>
