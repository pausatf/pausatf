										<font face="Arial"><font size="1">EUGENE, Ore. - Los Altos Hills' Grace Upshaw is headed to the Beijing Olympics as part of the U.S. track and field team.<br>
												<br>
												Upshaw, who trains at Stanford, earned a repeat trip to the Olympics with a second-place finish in the long jump late Thursday night at the Olympic Trials in Eugene, Ore. The Cal grad took the lead on her third jump with a personal best of 22 feet, 7 inches to all but secure one of three American spots in Beijing. That also placed her in the preferable last jumping position for the final three attempts.<br>
												<br>
												&quot;After getting a good mark (21-3 1/2) on my first jump, I was able to relax and focus on executing,&quot; Upshaw said. &quot;The winds were strong, so my coach (Edrick Floreal) thought I needed more runway to really attack the board. I am grateful, and I also got a PR, which didn't really surprise me because I know how I have been jumping in practice.&quot;<br>
												<br>
												Upshaw's lead held until the next-to-last jump of the competition. With the three Olympic berths already determined, then-second-place Brittney Reese produced the second-longest mark in the world this year, 22-9 3/4, to move into first. Upshaw managed 21-8 on the final try and settled for second place (and No. 6 on the world list in this Olympic season).<br>
												<br>
												Upshaw's previous best was 22-5 1/4 in 2004, when she was also second at the trials and finished 10th at the Athens Olympics. She won the U.S. championship in 2003, 2005 and 2007 and has finished as high as seventh at the world championships.<br>
												<br>
												&quot;This feels like the first step is over,&quot; Upshaw said. &quot;Four years ago, it was such a huge step for me to make the team. But this year I really want to do well in Beijing.&quot;<br>
												<br>
												The 32-year-old was wearing new good-luck charms but says she isn't superstitious.<br>
												<br>
												&quot;My sister gave me two necklaces a few weeks ago,&quot; Upshaw said. &quot;One says long, one says jump. I'll be wearing them in Beijing, too, after this.&quot;<br>
												<br>
												Her sister, Joy Upshaw Margerum, and niece, Sunny Margerum, both active competitors from Los Altos Hills, were part of a large familial contingent cheering in Eugene.<br>
												<br>
												&quot;It's great to have them be part of my track experience,&quot; Upshaw said.<br>
												<br>
												Her sister, a star in world masters competitions, also provides coaching assistance. The pair coached Sunny Margerum to a state meet berth for Gunn High School this season.<br>
												<br>
												Several athletes with Stanford ties advanced in qualifying rounds Thursday:<br>
												<br>
												- Gabe Jennings, the 2000 Olympic Trials 1,500 meters champion (when he also won the NCAA title for Stanford), won his first-round heat in 3:44.39. Stanford's Russell Brown also advanced in 3:43.79, as did ex-Cardinal Grant Robison (3:42.12).<br>
												<br>
												n Sara (Bei) Hall was among those advancing in the women's 1,500, running 4:18.00.<br>
												<br>
												- In the women's shot put qualifying, former Stanford star Jill Camarena was second at 58-7 1/2, and Cal grad Kristin Heaston (who has also worked at Stanford) was third at 57-10 1/2. They will compete for Olympic berths in today's finals.<br>
												<br>
												- Stanford grad Michael Robertson advanced to Sunday's discus finals, finishing seventh in qualifying at 198-1.<br>
												- Sarah Veress, currently training at Stanford, was fifth in women's hammer throw qualifying at 219-1. Finals are today.</font></font> </td>
