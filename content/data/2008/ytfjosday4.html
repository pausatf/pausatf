										OMAHA -- <b>Trinity Wilson</b> of the East Oakland YDC shattered the national youth record in the youth girls 100-meter hurdles Sunday, clocking 13.85 to shave .16 off the previous record set in 2001 by Domenique Manning to highlight the final day of the 42nd USA Track &amp; Field National Junior Olympic Championships at Burke High School.<br>
										<br>
											One other national youth record fell Sunday, in the young women's 400 hurdles, where Turquoise Thompson of Together Elite finished in 57.67 to lop .11 off the previous record set by Ebony Collins in 2006.<br>
										<br>
											In the young men's 110 hurdles, Booker Nunley of Track Eastern Carolina raced to a 13.41 to set a meet record. Nunley, who won silver at the IAAF World Youth Championships in Poland earlier this month, knocked .01 off the old meet record set by Terrence Trammell in 1997, and just missed the national youth record of 13.40 that has stood for 30 years.<br>
										<br>
										The USATF National Junior Olympic Track &amp; Field Championships is the largest and most visible youth athlete developmental program in the world. The Junior Olympics feature the following age divisions: Bantam (10 and under), Midget (11-12), Youth (13-14), Intermediate (15-16) and Young Men/Women (17-18).

Olympian Kerron Clement of La Porte, Texas, set the record of 49.77 in 2002.<br>
										<br>
											A little extra puff of wind denied Dior Hall of the Colorado Flyers the national youth record in the midget girls' 80 hurdles, but she won her third gold medal of the meet with an 11.81 clocking aided by a 2.1 meter-per-second wind. Kimani Hoffman of Track Xplosion also lost out on a meet record in the midget boys' long jump as his 5.66m/18-7 leap was aided by a 2.3 mps wind.<br>
