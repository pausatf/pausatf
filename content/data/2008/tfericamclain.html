										<p><font size="-1">Stanford senior Erica McLain was freaking out. Her friends were out and about interviewing for jobs, and there she was, playing in the sand each day.</font></p>
										<p><font size="-1">She may have been a seven-time All-American in the horizontal jumps, but McLain fretted that her devotion to track and field was leaving her behind her career-minded classmates.</font></p>
										<p><font size="-1">&ldquo;I was worried about whether I could make this my profession,&rdquo; McLain said. &ldquo;I kept telling myself that if I didn&rsquo;t jump well, I wouldn&rsquo;t get a (professional) contract. I didn&rsquo;t have a backup plan.&rdquo;</font></p>
										<p><font size="-1">Stanford track coach Edrick Floreal tried to reassure her.</font></p>
										<p><font size="-1">&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have time for a backup plan,&rdquo; Floreal said. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about making money. If you put the jumps out there, it&rsquo;s not going to be a problem.&rdquo;</font></p>
										<p><font size="-1">As she prepares for the biggest competition of her career, the U.S. Olympic Track &amp; Field Trials, McLain no longer feels quite so stressed. She put several jumps out there at the recent NCAA Outdoor Championships in Des Moines, Iowa, winning the triple jump with the longest mark ever by a collegian (47 feet, 10 inches). She earlier placed fourth in the long jump with a career 21-6.</font></p>
										<p><font size="-1">Her longest effort in the triple jump was wind-aided, so it didn&rsquo;t count as a collegiate record. But it was more than a foot farther than she had ever jumped before.</font></p>
										<p><font size="-1">&ldquo;I was so psyched when I saw the distance on the scoreboard,&rdquo; McLain said. &ldquo;I started laughing and said to myself, &lsquo;Who just did that? Me?&rsquo;</font></p>
										<p><font size="-1">&ldquo;I usually jump around and go crazy after a big jump, but this time I just sat down and started thinking about how I needed to get my head together, because this really would be my career for the next few years.&rdquo;</font></p>
										<p><font size="-1">When she and Floreal sat down a week later to review the video of her jump, they were surprised to see a bunch of little mistakes.</font></p>
										<p><font size="-1">&ldquo;It was not a pretty jump,&rdquo; McLain said. &ldquo;It was just a faster jump than my bad ones. I&rsquo;ve still got a lot of room for improvement.&rdquo;</font></p>
										<p><font size="-1">McLain, a 22-year-old native of Plano, Texas, will be competing in her first Olympic Trials. She qualified for the Trials in 2004 as a high school senior but chose to compete in the U.S. Junior Championships instead.</font></p>
										<p><font size="-1">These Olympic Trials will be held June 27 to July 6 in Eugene, Ore. McLain will also compete in the long jump, but the triple jump represents her best chance to earn a spot on the U.S. team for the Beijing Olympics.</font></p>
										<p><font size="-1">In most events, the top three finishers at the Trials qualify for the Olympic team. It&rsquo;s as simple as that. But McLain&rsquo;s situation is considerably more complicated. The women&rsquo;s triple jump is a weak event in the United States, and a top-three finish doesn&rsquo;t necessarily guarantee an Olympic berth.</font></p>
										<p><font size="-1">Athletes also need to meet or surpass the Olympic &ldquo;A&rdquo; qualifying standard, which in the women&rsquo;s triple jump is 46-7&frac14;. McLain hit that distance on the nose in finishing first at the 2008 NCAA Indoor Championships. Shani Marks jumped 46-11 in mid-June, so two Americans now have the &ldquo;A&rdquo; standard.</font></p>
										<p><font size="-1">That&rsquo;s a relief for McLain, because if she had been the only triple jumper with the &ldquo;A&rdquo; standard, she would have had to win the Trials to guarantee herself a spot on the Olympic team. If a jumper with the &ldquo;B&rdquo; standard had won in Eugene, the winner would have gone to Beijing instead. Now that two jumpers have the &ldquo;A&rdquo; standard, McLain might not have to finish in the top three in Eugene to qualify for the Olympics.</font></p>
										<p><font size="-1">If you&rsquo;re confused, take a number. Put simply, McLain has an excellent chance to make her first Olympic team.</font></p>
										<p><font size="-1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the game plan,&rdquo; Floreal said. &ldquo;There a lot of outside stuff at the Olympic Trials that can distract you, but when it&rsquo;s game time, Erica gets into her own world.&rdquo;</font></p>
										<p><font size="-1">McLain earned a slew of national honors at Plano East High School, including three Texas state titles and a U.S. junior championship in the long jump. She won the long jump and triple jump at the 2002 Golden West Invitational in Sacramento.</font></p>

										<p><font size="-1">She never seriously considered any college other than Stanford. Her mother, Terrie, grew up in Marin County, so Erica had some familiarity with the Bay Area.</font></p>
										<p><font size="-1">&ldquo;The No. 1 thing for me was to go to an academic school,&rdquo; McLain said. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t even know that Edrick was a great triple jumper. I really lucked out.&rdquo;</font></p>
										<p><font size="-1">Floreal was a five-time NCAA champion for Arkansas and twice represented Canada at the Olympic Games. They hit it off immediately. McLain set a U.S. junior record of 45-11 in winning the U.S. senior title as a Stanford freshman in 2005. McLain won NCAA indoor titles in the triple jump in 2007 and 2008.</font></p>
										<p><font size="-1">But it wasn&rsquo;t until her final NCAA meet that she won a national collegiate outdoor title.</font></p>
										<p><font size="-1">&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to leave college without an outdoor title,&rdquo; McLain said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always been so close.&rdquo;</font></p>
										<p><font size="-1">McLain was particularly encouraged by how fresh her legs felt during the NCAA triple jump final. It was his fourth straight day of jumping, and she hit her windy 47-10&frac34; on her sixth and final effort.</font></p>
										<p><font size="-1">&ldquo;Last year, I was so dead after the triple jump that I couldn&rsquo;t even walk the next day,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We planned this season as though it would last through September.&rdquo;</font></p>
										<p><font size="-1">The triple jump final at the Olympic Trials is Sunday, June 29. Fatigue shouldn&rsquo;t be a problem, since the triple jump comes before the long jump on the Trials schedule. She&rsquo;s not sure whether she&rsquo;ll sign with a shoe company before the Trials, but she doesn&rsquo;t sound worried.</font></p>
										<p><font size="-1">&ldquo;I just want to focus on my jumping right now,&rdquo; McLain said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m prepared for my competitors to throw some big jumps out there. I just need to be me. My best jumps come when I&rsquo;m smiling on the runway.&rdquo;</font></p>
