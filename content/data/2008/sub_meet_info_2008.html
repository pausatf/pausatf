<b><font size="3">LOCATION:</font></b>   Granada High School, 400 Wall Street, Livermore, CA 94550

Welcome to the 5th Annual Subbantam Championships Track and Field Meet of the Pacific Association. 
In calendar year 2008, Subbantams are athletes born in the year 2000 or later. The Youth Committee 
team members, family and friends, are hosting this meet again. Yes, we’re still doing it; and with 
your help and support we will continue for years to come. To make this work, your volunteer services 
are still much needed and greatly appreciated. We want another successful Subbantam Championships meet 
this year, so again, let’s make it happen!!

Athletes must be capable of contesting their event efficiently. We cannot allow exceptionally young children 
to participate in the longer races and field events. Therefore, no children under the age of 5 will be allowed 
to contest the 400 and 800 meter running events or mini jav, shot put and high jump field events. 

It has been requested more than once so we’re offering the high jump for the first time for our 7 and 8 year olds. 
The shot put will be 4 pounds for this track meet instead of the regulation 6 pounds used for the Bantam age group. 
The mini jav is also being offered again so coaches, it is imperative that you train your Subbantams in these three 
field event areas if you are going to have them contest the events! We want no unnecessary accidents. 

Our preference is pre-registration using our Club Manager computer program. However, if you are using the postal 
snail mail system, please pre-register with a postmark date of no later than Friday, June 20, 2008. If you have any 
questions do not hesitate to contact Joanne Slaton-Camargo at <a href="mailto:pa.youthchair@yahoo.com">pa.youthchair@yahoo.com</a> or call at (510) 879-8642 or 
(510) 430-8223 OR Maria Castillo at <a href="mailto:pa.youth_officialschair@yahoo.com">pa.youth_officialschair@yahoo.com</a> or (707) 648-3423.

Awards for this track meet are medals 1-3 and ribbons 4-8 in each heat or flight. The outstanding male and female 
athlete of the day will be presented with a trophy at the end of the track meet. Each athlete will also receive a 
Subbantam track meet t-shirt at the start of the track meet. We’re hosting a dance contest at the end of the day, 
so parents and coaches make sure you stick around for the show. 1st and 2nd place awards will be presented to each 
male and each female winner of the contest.

Entry fee is $8 per athlete. Make cashiers check or money order payable to Pacific Association USATF or simply PA/USATF. 
No personal checks please. Enter your athlete(s) via email using Club Manager to Anthony Camargo at <a href="mailto:pa.youthentries@yahoo.com">pa.youthentries@yahoo.com</a>
