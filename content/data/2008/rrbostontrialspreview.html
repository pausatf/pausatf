								<b>Russell and Lewy-Boulet Record Successful Tune-Ups at Stanford <br>
									Invitational<br>
								</b><br>
								Note to Editors: A list of all 18 PA/USATF qualifiers, including cities <br>
								of residence, appears at the end of this release.<br>
								<br>
								FOLSOM, Calif. - April 7, 2008 - When approximately 125 women line up for <br>
								the 2008 U.S. Olympic Team Trials - Women's Marathon in Boston, Mass. on <br>
								Sunday, April 20, several Pacific Association/USA Track &amp; Field <br>
								(PA/USATF) athletes will be among the top contenders favored to earn a <br>
								spot on the U.S. Olympic Team. The top three finishers in the Trials race <br>
								will qualify for the 2008 U.S. women's Olympic marathon team going to <br>
								Beijing, China, provided each has achieved the Olympic &quot;A&quot; qualification <br>
								standard of 2 hours, 37 minutes or faster. Athletes at the Trials, which <br>
								will run the day before the 112th Boston Marathon, will compete for <br>
								$260,000 in prize money and bonuses.<br>
								<br>
								PA/USATF athletes Blake Russell (Pacific Grove, Calif.) and Magdalena <br>
								Lewy-Boulet (Oakland, Calif.) finished fourth and fifth, respectively, at <br>
								the 2004 U.S. Women's Olympic Marathon Trials in St. Louis -- the <br>
								bridesmaid spots for fulfilling their Olympic dreams. Both athletes <br>
								return to the 2008 Trials with unfinished business. They will compete in, <br>
								perhaps, the most competitive field ever to line up for the Trials race.<br>
								<br>
								Last Friday, April 4, Russell and Lewy-Boulet had successful final <br>
								tune-up outings for the Trials at the Stanford Invitational track meet. <br>
								In the 10,000-meter race at Stanford, Russell placed second in 32 <br>
								minutes, 14.91 seconds. Lewy-Boulet was third in a personal record time <br>
								of 32:33.02.<br>
								<br>
								Kate O'Neill (Palo Alto, Calif.) is a relative newcomer to PA/USATF ranks <br>
								and to the marathon distance, but she has Olympic experience (2004) at <br>
								10,000 meters, and now has a spectacular debut marathon on her resume.<br>
								<br>
								Forty-six-year-old Linda Somers Smith (Arroyo Grande, Calif.) is not <br>
								expected to contend for a team spot at the Trials. The 1996 Olympian, <br>
								however, will compete in the 2008 Olympic Trials having qualified for six <br>
								U.S. Women's Olympic Marathon Trials races since its inaugural running in <br>
								1984. Somers Smith placed 31st in the Olympic Games marathon in Atlanta.<br>
								<br>
								Russell, Lewy-Boulet, O'Neill, and Somers Smith are among a strong <br>
								contingent of PA/USATF women who have qualified for the Trials. Among the <br>
								181 U.S. women who have qualified, PA/USATF and USATF Colorado each have <br>
								18 qualifiers -- tied for the most among all 57 of USATF's <br>
								geographically-based Associations. California leads all states with 26 <br>
								qualifiers.<br>
								<br>
								To qualify for the Trials, women had to record a marathon time equal to <br>
								or better than USA Track &amp; Field's qualifying standards: 2 hours, 39 <br>
								minutes flat (&quot;A&quot; standard, Trials travel expenses paid) or 2:47:00 (&quot;B&quot; <br>
								standard, travel expenses not paid). The qualifying period for the Trials <br>
								was January 1, 2006 through March 23, 2008.<br>
								<br>
								Russell, 32, ran the boldest race at the 2004 Women's Olympic Marathon <br>
								Trials, despite the fact that it was only her second marathon. She built <br>
								a commanding early lead and held it for almost 18 miles before eventually <br>
								finishing fourth in 2:30:32 behind the top three (Colleen De Reuck, Deena <br>
								Kastor, and Jen Rhines). Russell is coached by legendary Bob Sevene <br>
								(Seaside, Calif.), who guided American standout Joan Benoit to a gold <br>
								medal in the first-ever women's Olympic Games marathon in Los Angeles in <br>
								1984.<br>
								<br>
								Russell said the nightmare of getting passed by Rhines in the final half <br>
								mile at the '04 Trials, and missing an Olympic berth by one place, still <br>
								lingers. But training alone along the beautiful Monterey Peninsula <br>
								coastline, she has had a lot of time to reconcile her disappointment, and <br>
								plan for the future.<br>
									<br>
								&quot;I don't think anything really went wrong four years ago. I made a few <br>
								rookie mistakes,&quot; Russell said as she described how she ran the entire <br>
								race while taking only a couple of sips of water. &quot;But it was one of <br>
								those days when you feel really good and you want to go with it.&quot;<br>
								<br>
								Said Sevene: &quot;Blake was a marathon rookie in 2004. I think she would have <br>
								made the team if she took [water]. She went out too fast. But she has a <br>
								lot more experience now. I'm very pleased with her recent training.&quot;<br>
								<br>
								Russell followed her 2:30:32 Trials' performance with a 2:29:10 personal <br>
								record at the 2005 Chicago Marathon (a time that puts her among the top <br>
								15 U.S. women ever on a non-aided course). In 2006, she picked up U.S. <br>
								national 15K and cross country long course titles. Last February, Russell <br>
								placed 6th at the USA Cross Country Championships and earned a spot on <br>
								the U.S. world cross country team, but she declined a trip to the IAAF <br>
								World Cross Country Championships to focus on her marathon trials <br>
								preparations.<br>
								<br>
								Sevene, who originally hails from the Boston area, believes that the <br>
								relatively flat Olympic Marathon Trials course in Boston favors runners <br>
								such as Russell who have a marathoner's strength, plus good leg speed <br>
								honed on the track. Russell's track credentials include a very fast <br>
								31:35.25 for 10,000 meters.<br>
								<br>
								The Trials' course, created specifically for the event, contains five <br>
								loops -- an initial loop of about 2.2 miles that tours historic Boston, <br>
								followed by four loops of approximately six miles each through Boston's <br>
								Back Bay, across the Charles River. and into Cambridge. The race starts <br>
								and finishes near the traditional Boston Marathon finish line on Boylston <br>
								Street.<br>
								<br>
								&quot;I think it's going to be very fast provided the weather cooperates,&quot; <br>
								said Sevene. &quot;I'm going out on a limb and say it's going to take a 2:28 <br>
								(time) to make the team. I think it's going to be a wonderful race.&quot;<br>
								<br>
								In 2004, for the first time at the same Women's Olympic Marathon Trials, <br>
								three women ran sub-2:30. Among the 2008 Trials qualifiers, less than a <br>
								handful have ever run under 2:29: U.S. record holder Deena Kastor <br>
								(2:19:36), Joan Benoit Samuelson (2:21:21), 2004 Trials champion De Reuck <br>
								(2:26:35), and Marla Runyan (2:27:10). But, the history of the Marathon <br>
								Trials demonstrates that U.S. athletes rise to the occasion in <br>
								spectacular fashion. For example, at the 2004 women's trials, 10 of the <br>
								top 15 finishers ran personal records.<br>
								<br>
								&quot;You can't count anybody out,&quot; said Kastor (Mammoth Lakes, Calif.), the <br>
								2004 Olympic Games bronze medalist in the women's marathon who is the <br>
								top-seeded competitor going into Boston. &quot;You have to be prepared for <br>
								anything. There's so much time for something to happen in the marathon. <br>
								And, you can count on everybody showing up on race day to give it their <br>
								best.&quot;<br>
								<br>
								Like Boston's weather in April, it's difficult to predict how a marathon <br>
								trials race will play out. For 34-year-old Magdalena Lewy-Boulet that <br>
								means sticking to a tried-and-true race plan that nabbed her an <br>
								oh-so-close fifth place at the 2004 Trials. Her coach, well-respected <br>
								Jack Daniels, oversees her preparations.<br>
									<br>
								&quot;My motivation may be different, but the way I approach the race is still <br>
								about the same,&quot; said the former University of California Berkeley <br>
								All-American who is married to another Cal All-American, Richie Boulet. <br>
								&quot;I want to make my (almost three-year old) son, Owen, proud. I want to <br>
								show Owen what hard work is. I'm going to run my own race, and, <br>
								hopefully, the shape I'm in will get me on the team.&quot;<br>
								<br>
								Lewy-Boulet feels that the '08 Trials field is just as competitive, if <br>
								not more so, than four years ago. That means she will, most likely, need <br>
								to improve upon her 2:30:50 personal record that she ran at the last <br>
								Trials. Lewy-Boulet, however, has demonstrated that she knows how to peak <br>
								for big races.<br>
								<br>
								Kate O'Neill is a Boston area transplant who moved to California several <br>
								years ago and trains with Team Running USA in Mammoth Lakes, Calif. Last <br>
								October, she made a sensational debut on the marathon scene with a third <br>
								place 2:36:15 at an unseasonably hot LaSalle Bank Chicago Marathon. The <br>
								27-year-old, seven-time NCAA All-American at Yale University will have a <br>
								hometown crowd behind her in Boston. Although O'Neill's marathon <br>
								experience is limited, her strengths make her a favored contender. In <br>
								2004, she placed third at the USA Olympic Track &amp; Field Trials at 10,000m <br>
								and competed in the Athens Olympic Games.<br>
								<br>
								For some women, simply lining up on the starting line for the 2008 U.S. <br>
								Olympic Team Trials - Women's Marathon will signify an &quot;Olympic&quot; dream <br>
								come true. For PA/USATF's Shaluinn Fullove, a former track and field and <br>
								cross country competitor at Stanford University, qualifying for the <br>
								Trials was a remote possibility only three years ago. In the early spring <br>
								of 2005, the 30-year-old Palo Alto, Calif. resident was diagnosed with <br>
								thyroid cancer. After receiving a thyroidectomy and radiation treatments, <br>
								Fullove eventually resumed serious training. On March 3, 2008 Fullove <br>
								qualified for the Trials at the Kaiser Permanente Napa Valley Marathon, <br>
								fulfilling her dream.<br>
