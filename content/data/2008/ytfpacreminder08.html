										REMINDER:&nbsp; <b>The deadline to register for the (PAC) Pacific Association Championships is May 31, not May 1 as previously noted.</b>&nbsp; 
										<p>Your team must be a registered USATF team and all athletes on your team must be registered USATF members.&nbsp;&nbsp; And please remember, you must have a registered live-scanned coach or designated person to pick up your team packet.<br>
											<br>
											For clarification purposes, the PAC meet is&nbsp;NOT&nbsp;the qualifier for&nbsp;our association Top 8 Junior Olympic track meet.&nbsp;&nbsp;The JO qualifier meet is scheduled for June 20-22 at Granada High School in Livermore.&nbsp; The deadline date to register for the JO&nbsp;track meet is Wednesday, June 11th, not the 4th as previously stated in the meet information.&nbsp; The deadline to mail your entry fees is changed to Thursday, June 12th not the 5th.&nbsp; Please contact meet directors if you have further questions or concerns.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
											<br>
											Please remember to&nbsp;bring your JO 3-part advancement form to our PAC meet on June 7-8 in Rocklin to be stamped by our Membership Chairperson,&nbsp;Tony Williams.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
											<br>
											If you are a team, please remember to bring your team binders to&nbsp;all remaining track&nbsp;meets.&nbsp; If you do not have a binder contact Maria Castillo at pa.youth_officialschair@yahoo.com.&nbsp; <br>
											<br>
											Please send all championship track meet entries, using Club Manager,&nbsp;to Anthony Camargo at pa.youthentries@yahoo.com.&nbsp; If you do not have a copy of Club Manager, send an email request&nbsp;and he will email&nbsp;a copy&nbsp;to you.<br>
											<br>
											It is not mandatory, but we would appreciate your team volunteering for our championship meets.&nbsp; Remember, we cannot host our meets without volunteer help to put them on and the proceeds from those meets is paid out to those teams who have volunteered their services for the good of our association youth.&nbsp; If interested in a volunteer position, please contact Debra Harvey and she will take care of you.&nbsp; pa.youth_vicechair@yahoo.com <br>
											<br>
											It has come to our attention that their has been problems with the customary rule or courtesy regarding reserving a space in the stands at our track meets.&nbsp; If someone arrives and places their canopy/tarp in a place to reserve it, that must be honored.&nbsp; You cannot negate that team/persons position just because you do not physically see a body there.&nbsp; Please make sure these courtesies are adhered to for future meets.&nbsp;<br>
											<br>
											Thank you, and we look forward to seeing you at our first championship meet on June 7 at Rocklin High School in Rocklin, CA.&nbsp; <br>
