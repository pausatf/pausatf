									&nbsp;The boys and girls high school track athletes of the year for 2008 are from the Pacific Association of USA Track &amp; Field.<br>
									&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;The All USA Today team, featured on the back page of Wednesday&rsquo;s (July 23) sports section, heralds records breakers German Fernandez of Riverbank and Jordan Hasay of Mission Prep, San Luis Obispo atop the annual selections.<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									&nbsp;Included on the All-USA boys team is national pole vault leader <b>Nico Weiler </b>of &nbsp;Los Gatos (17-4 1/2). &nbsp;The girls team has the <b>Purvis sisters, Ashton and Julian</b> of St. Elizabeth (Oakland), in the sprints and hurdles; long and triple jump leader <b>Vashti Thomas</b> of Mt. Pleasant (San Jose); triple jumper <b>Alitta Boyd</b> of Moreau Catholic (Hayward); and distance star <b>Laurynne Chetelat</b> of Davis. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
									Nine additional athletes from other California regions were honored. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									<b>FERNANDEZ SMASHES RECORDS:<br>
									</b>Oklahoma State-bound Fernandez &nbsp;set high school records from 3,000 meters through two miles and produced the best ever one-day 1,600-3,200 double at the California state meet. &nbsp;<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									He capped a phenomenal 22-day span with a two mile victory over the season&rsquo;s other top runners at the Nike Outdoor Nationals in Greensboro (N.C.) on June 21. &nbsp;His time of 8 minutes, 34.40 seconds, broke a 29-year-old record. &nbsp;En route Fernandez became the first high school athlete to better eight minutes for 3,000 meters, officially clocking 7:59.83.<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									At the state finals, on May 31, he won the 1,600 meters in 4:00.29 (third fastest in a high school race behind Jim Ryun&rsquo;s 3:58.3 in 1965 for the slightly longer mile and Alan Webb&rsquo;s Federation record of 3:59.51 in 2001.). &nbsp;Fernandez completed his historic double in the 3,200 in 8:34.23, taking nearly seven seconds off the National Federation record. &nbsp;<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									<b>HASAY LEADS GIRLS DISTANCE STARS: </b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
									&nbsp;Hasay broke the less than three-week-old 1,500 meter record (of state rival Christine Babcock of Woodbridge) at the U.S. Olympic Trials in Eugene, Ore. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
									&nbsp;<br>Preceding each of Fernandez&rsquo; state races at Cerritos College in Norwalk were girls record performances. &nbsp;Babcock, also an All-USA pick, ran the fastest ever girls 1,600 meters in 4:33.81. &nbsp;Hasay set junior class and age 16 records with the No. 2 all-time 3,200 time, 9:52.13, just holding off Chetelat, who ran 9:52.51 for No. 3 all-time.<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									Hasay only made the top 30 cut for the Olympic Trials 1,500, w ith her previous best of 4:16.98 (a sophomore class record run in 2007), when a couple of elite runners decided not to double in that event. &nbsp;The 1,500 is not run in normal high school competition. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
									&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Hasay advanced from the Trials heats (as did Babcock) and then grabbed the spotlight with her all-time record 4:14.45 clocking in the semifinals. &nbsp;She then needed to win an appeal to stay in Eugene long enough to run in the final. &nbsp;Hasay was expected to board a plane for Poland the day after the semis to compete in the World Junior championships. &nbsp;&nbsp;A week before the Trials she had repeated as USA Junior (under age 20) champion.<br>
									&nbsp;<br>Given a reprieve, Hasay gained the valuable experience of running in a U.S. Olympic Trials final , where she ran well in a tactical race and finished tenth in 4:17.36. &nbsp;The following week, in Bydgoszcz, Poland, Hasay placed fourth in the World Junior final in 4:19.02, just missing the bronze medal. &nbsp;&ldquo;On the last lap I tried to move up, but go bumped out of my spot,&rdquo; she said after the climatic race of her junior high school year. &nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay. &nbsp;I just couldn&rsquo;t get them at the end. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m happy with everything.&rdquo; &nbsp;<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									Also at the World meet, Chetelat -- a graduating senior -- finished sixth in the 3,000 in 9:15.11, No. 6 all-time. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
									
Hasay this season set age 16 and junior class records in the 3,000.<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;### &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
									(Reporter&rsquo;s note: Although I again served as editor for the All-USA TODAY team, the athlete of the year selections were made by my boys and girls team compilers, who do not reside in the Pacific Association area.) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
