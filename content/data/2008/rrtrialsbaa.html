											Boston, Mass. -- On a spectacular Sunday morning in Boston, the top<br>
											female marathoners in the United States put forth an historic<br>
											performance. Deena Kastor, Magdalena Lewy Boulet, and Blake Russell<br>
											headlined the April 20 show as they captured the three spots on the U.S.<br>
											Olympic Team for the women's marathon. As a result, their next marathon<br>
											will be run through the streets of Beijing on August 17 as they compete<br>
											in the 2008 Olympic Games. Behind the three Olympians, 143 other women<br>
											thrilled the tens of thousands of spectators and viewers on<br>
											NBCSports.com with one of the greatest women's marathons ever held.<br>
											<br>
											A one-hour highlight show of the event will air on Sunday, April 27 on<br>
											MSNBC from 12:00-1:00 p.m. ET. Commentary will be provided by<br>
											commentator Al Trautwig and 10-time NCAA All-American Ed Eyestone. The<br>
											show will be the premier episode in a series highlighting a number of<br>
											Olympic Trials events leading up to the Beijing Olympic Games in August.<br>
											The Olympic Trials online and over the air broadcast is a joint<br>
											production of the USOC, Boston Athletic Association, NBC Sports and USA<br>
											Track &amp; Field.<br>

										<p><font size="-1"><b>Athletes</b></font></p>
										<blockquote>

										<blockquote>
											<p><font size="-1">* 98 women ran under 2:50. This is the second largest total in the<br>
													history of women's marathon running, trailing only the 1984 U.S. Olympic<br>
													Trials when 109 women broke that mark.<br>
													* By comparison, 61 women broke 2:50 at the 2004 U.S. Olympic Team<br>
													Trials-Women's Marathon. 44 did so in 2000; 71 in 1996; 46 in 1992; and<br>
													81 in 1988.</font></p>
										</blockquote>
										<p><font size="-1"><b>All-Time Rankings</b></font></p>
										<blockquote>
											<p><font size="-1">* Deena Kastor and Magdalena Lewy Boulet ran the 2nd and 11th<br>
													fastest Olympic Trials performances in U.S. history.<br>
													* Kastor's winning time of 2:29:35 is the 41st fastest marathon<br>
													ever run by an American woman. She also owns the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 10th,<br>
													12th, 14th, and 43rd-fastest times.<br>
													* Lewy Boulet's second-place time of 2:30:19 is the 53rd fastest<br>
													marathon ever run by an American woman.</font></p>
										</blockquote>
										<p><font size="-1"><b>Age Group Records</b></font></p>
										<blockquote>
											<p><font size="-1">* Linda Somers Smith (2:38:49) sets U.S. 45+ record. (Previous<br>
													best was Joan Samuelson, 2:42:28.)<br>

													marathon time).<br>
													* 41 women ran new personal bests on Sunday, including 13 of the<br>
													top 15 and 20 of the top 26.<br>
													* 47 women improved upon their qualifying performance for the<br>
													event (including Blake Russell who qualified via a 10,000m time because<br>
													she did not have a qualifying marathon performance).</font></p>
										</blockquote>
										<p><font size="-1"><b>U.S. Championships</b></font></p>
										<blockquote>
											<p><font size="-1">* Deena Kastor won her third U.S. Marathon Championship (2001 and<br>
													2007), and become the first woman since Linda Somers (in 1993-1994) to<br>
													win back-to-back titles.<br>
													* Kastor becomes the first woman to win three U.S. championships<br>
													in the marathon. Julie Brown, Janis Klecker, and Linda Somers each won<br>
													two. </font></p>

										<blockquote>
											<p><font size="-1">* Kastor joins Cathy O'Brien as the only women to make two U.S.<br>
													Olympic Teams in the Women's Marathon.<br>
													* This represents the first time that the first alternate from an<br>
													Olympic Team (Blake Russell in 2004) has made the Olympic Team four<br>
													years later.<br>
													* The 4th and 5th-place finishers from 2004 (Russell and Lewy<br>
													Boulet, who finished just 35 and 53 seconds out of third place,<br>
													respectively, in 2004) both made the Olympic Team this year.</font></p>
