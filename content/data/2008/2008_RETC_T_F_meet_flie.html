      RETC will provide a snack bar with hot meal-deals
      for breakfast & lunch (school does not allow BBQs to be brought on campus)</li>
    <li><u>USATF Membership</u>:
      PA/USATF Board voted that beginning with the
      2007 T&F season all youth athletes must join PA/USATF before they can
      compete in a sanctioned USATF meet.
      Join before coming to the meet or at
      the meet. </li>
    <ul>
      <li><u>NOTE</u>:
        If a club is not a registered 2008 club in
        good standing then all athletes associated with that club will need to
        transition to another club or compete unattached.
        If the athlete chooses
        to compete unattached then they should not wear their club uniform
        (simple as turning it inside out if necessary)</li>
    </ul>
    <li><u>Registration</u>:
      Online registration must be received by
      midnight February 23.
      Same day registration = $12 per athlete and not
      accepted after 7:00 am morning of the meet.
      Check the RETC website 
	  (<a href="http://www.eteamz.com/RosevilleExpress">www.eteamz.com/RosevilleExpress</a>)
      to confirm unattached and club entries have been received.
      Use Club Manager to submit entries via Craig (meet timer) at 
	  <a href="mailto:redcaptiming@gmail.com">redcaptiming@gmail.com</a> </li>
	  <ul>
      <li>If you have never used Club Manager before contact Charlie Sheppard at

      </ul>
    <li><u>Relays</u>:
      An unattached athlete may not compete on a
      relay team (this is a USATF rule); clubs attending the meet are requested
      to provide 1-2 officials at the time of the relays to assist with relay
      exchange zone judging (meet at the finish line prior to the start of the
      first relay); remind your athletes to pull their tape from the track after
      they complete a relay exchange</li>
    <li><u>Seeding</u>:
      Our best efforts will be made to seed heats so
      that two athletes from the same club will not be in the same heat.
      Since
      this is the first sectional meet of the season seeding times / distances
      are not necessary when you register</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Last heat of each age
        group in 100m, 200m and 400m is fast heat.
        If you have a youth athlete
        that should be in the fast heat ensure you instruct your athlete to notify
        the clerk area when they check in</li>
    </ul>
    <li><u>Volunteers</u>:
      RETC will be providing all volunteers to run
      this meet.
      We want coaches and parents to be able to focus on coaching
      & cheering everyone as they compete; however, if you see an area that
      is struggling bring it to the attention of the meet director or jump in
      and help</li>
    <li><u>Access to infield</u>:
      No coaches on infield except coaches clearly
      displaying 2008 PA/USATF membership ID cards and assisting Sub-Bantam and
      Bantam long jumpers setting marks.
      Coaches must leave when the event

  Depending on number of athletes
  in each event the Race Walks and 3000m / 5000m runs may have all age groups
  compete in one heat, during designated time in schedule.
  Additional races
  could be combined depending on number of athletes. <br />
  <br />
  <b>Order of running

  This year RETC is trying
  something new.
  For the Bantam, Midget & Youth age groups we will offer a Multi
  competition along with regular events.
  Athletes who sign up for the Multi will
  not do any other event at the meet.
  Athletes in the Multis will stay as a
  group and progress from one event to the next.
