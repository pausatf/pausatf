Only the 5th meet of the season ..... The one-day event at San Rafael High school kicked off with final tune up and though the calendar still reads March, April appears to promise of some exciting competitions.<br>
															<font size="2"><br>
															</font>Headlining the action included some of the association heavy hitters that included Atiya Harvey of Mission Valley, Amira Godfrey-Woods of E.O.Y.D.C, Jasiri Blake and Breann Wilson of Hilltop Speed and Kylie Palacio now Unattached.<br>
															<font size="2"><br>
															</font>After an Outstanding 2007 season, the Reigning Junior Olympic 100m Champion Atiya Harvey opened her season with a mark of 12.44h with Amira Godfrey-Woods at a close second with 12.66h to finish the Youth Girls 100m. Both did well meeting the USATF provisional qualifying standards. Breann Wilson of Hilltop Speed took a close 3rd behind the duo, but missing in the action was Hilltop's Daniela Pacini who last year earned the name &quot;Brave Heart&quot; for her most memorable performance at the 2007 Top 3 qualifier. Daniela is resting an injury suffered before coming into the 2008 season so we wish her well and good health and hope to see her back on the track in time for the Big Championship meets.</font></td>

Running for LSI in the Midget Boys 400 was Cameron Meszaros. Taking the lead during the first turn and improving upon it with each stride, Cameron clocked a 1:03 to finish and improve upon a personal best easily reaching the USATF provisional standards. Says Coach Hill &quot;Cameron came to us from ISC under coach Chioke Robinson. So he's been trained under a very good program. Coming late into the season we got a benchmark of 1:06 last weekend and made a few adjustment in this meet and was able to improved on his performance.&quot;<br>
															<font size="2"><br>
															</font>The Midget Boys 80 meter hurdles went to LSI's Tyson Hill, running 14.5 seconds to cruise into First place. Hill was never challenged as he won his race by more than 2 hurdles. In the last two meets Hill has been struggling to get his rhythm to the first hurdle. Says Coach Hill &quot;I was hoping for a little more consistency before heading to Arizona this weekend. We've been having some good practices and his touch down times shows that he can run under 13 seconds. However; a tremendous amount of focus will be needed to put that race together. If he can do that then there's no doubt in my mind that he can act physically on it&quot;<br>
															<font size="2"><br>
															</font>Staying on top of all the action was Jalen Doss with another impressive performance in both the Midget Boys 400 and 800 run. He's definitely proving to be the one to beat as he continues his quest to double the trouble at the PA Championships.</font></td>

Taylor Craft of Mission Valley claimed 2nd and looks to be improving with each meet. Say Coach Craft &quot;I'm happy where we are with Taylor. We've been working on getting her 3 step down and now she's starting to show some consistency that only comes with time and experience. We've also been training on being aggressive and attacking the hurdles and these are the technical aspects that we carry into the meet&quot; Coach craft is also the Proud Father of Taylor who is only in her 2nd season of Track and Field and already starting to show great prowess.<br>
