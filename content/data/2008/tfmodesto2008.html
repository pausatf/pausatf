										<p>Cantwell, Stuczynski shine at California Relays<br>
											<br>
											Christian Cantwell and Jenn Stuczynski posted world leading marks in<br>
											winning their respective events Saturday at the 67th California<br>
											Invitational Relays in Modesto, Calif.<br>
											<br>
											A two-time World Indoor men's shot put gold medalist and 2007 Indoor<br>
											Visa Series Champion, Cantwell unleashed a world leading throw of 21.76<br>
											meters/71 feet 4.75 inches to win the men's shot put.<br>
											<br>
											Cantwell, who is slated to compete Sunday at the adidas Track Classic in<br>
											Carson, Calif., took full advantage of competing on a plywood surface.<br>
											&quot;It was slippery at first,&quot; he told the IAAF website. &quot;I slipped about 8<br>
											cm on my first throw. But then I knew the right adjustment to make. I<br>
											really like throwing on plywood. I'm heavy, and many times a concrete<br>
											ring will have too rough a surface for me to get speed. On plywood, I<br>
											can slide much better. And it's easier on the joints.&quot;<br>
											<br>
											2008 World Indoor Championships silver medalist and American outdoor<br>
											record holder Jenn Stuczynski again demonstrated her dominance in the<br>
											women's pole vault with her 2008 world best clearance of 4.70 meters/15<br>
											feet 5 inches. It was her first attempt of the day taken after the other<br>
											competitors had exited the competition. Stuczynski then had the bar<br>
											raised to an American record 4.90m/16-0.75 but failed to clear in three<br>
											attempts.<br>
											<br>
											This marked the first time that Stuczynski had ever started a<br>
											competition at that height. &quot;Normally, I like to start at about 4.50<br>
											(14-9),&quot; she said. &quot;But with the heat, I knew I didn't have a lot of<br>
											jumps in me. I started running out of steam at the end, but I thought I<br>
											could get 4.90. I had jumped it in warm ups.&quot; Stuczynski, who owns the<br>
											top two clearances in the world this year, is slated to compete Sunday<br>
											at the adidas Track Classic and at the Reebok Grand Prix in New York on<br>
											June 8.<br>
											<br>
											On the track, 2005 World 100m women's champion Lauryn Williams was<br>
											victorious in that event in 11.18 seconds defeating two-time 100m<br>
											hurdles World champion Michelle Perry, who started well and had the lead<br>
											midway through the race before a cramp kept her from challenging the<br>
											rest of the way. Later that afternoon, Williams completed her double<br>
											with a win in the 200 meters in 22.85 seconds. Williams said that her<br>
											intention is to dabble some in the 200m, believing it will make her<br>
											stronger in her primary event, the 100 meters.<br>
											<br>
											2008 World Indoor Championships 60m fourth-placer Mike Rodgers continued<br>
											his impressive 2008 campaign with the fastest wind-legal performance in<br>
											the men's 100m with his personal best time of 10.06.<br>
											<br>
											World Indoor 60m hurdles silver medalist Candice Davis equaled her 100m<br>
											hurdles personal best with her win in 12.80 seconds. Two-time U.S.<br>
											heptathlon champion Hyleas Fountain ran a sub-13 for the second time<br>
											this season in equaling her 12.98 posted in Berkeley two weeks ago. The<br>
											men's 110m hurdles was won by Anwar Moore, who won this event for the<br>
											second year in a row in a wind aided (+2.1) 13.32 seconds.<br>
											<br>
											Also on the track, four-time USA Outdoor champion and 2004 Olympian<br>
											Khadevis Robinson was victorious in the men's 800 meters leading<br>
											throughout the contest and crossing the finish line in 1:47.32.<br>
