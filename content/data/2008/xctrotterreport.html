									<i>Note: Kathleen placed 12th (27:28) out of 81 entrants in the Women&rsquo;s Open Division which was won by Shalane Flanagan of Pittsboro NC &nbsp;in 25:26.<br>

										The USA Cross Country Championships in San Diego the weekend of February 16 and 17 certainly did not disappoint both athletes and spectators alike. The course itself traversed through the well-manicured terrain of Mission Bay Park, keeping true to the sport of cross country by traveling over every undulation it had to offer! Spectators could easily watch and cheer for the athletes while running to different points along the course and logging a few miles themselves. Everyone surely appreciated the blue skies and welcoming sway of palm trees that greeted all (maybe not those arriving on Thursday!) to San Diego - a stark contrast to the snow, mud, and cold that many experienced at Club Nationals!<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
										Having gotten over my fear of racing four 2k loops, I decided the Championship would be the perfect opportunity for me to race against great competition. Indeed it was GREAT competition! Highly accomplished runners comprised the field and Shalane made us all seem like we were jogging! I personally could not be happier with my first 8-kilometer effort at a national venue like that! I felt that I accomplished my goals, which were to stay positive and focused through all the loops (especially the third loop) and finish knowing that I ran a well-controlled, competitive race, reflective of some of the training that I have been doing. All in all, it was a great weekend!<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
										I would like to thank the Pacific Association for sending me to this race, and thanks go to USATF for a well-organized event, culminating with exciting races that made it a weekend for all to enjoy. I am confident that those selected to run at Worlds are USA's best! GOOD LUCK and RUN FAST!<br>
