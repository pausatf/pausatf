												<p><font size="-1"><b>A</b>t the U.S. Olympic Team Trials-Women&rsquo;s Marathon on April 20, 2008 in Boston, Linda Somers Smith (Arroyo Grande, Calif.) set a U.S. record for women ages 45 to 49. The &lsquo;96 Olympian&rsquo;s finishing time of 2 hours, 38 minutes, and 49 seconds smashed 1984 Olympic gold medalist Joan Benoit Samuelson&rsquo;s currently listed U.S. W45-49 record of 2:42:28. Somers Smith&#151;who celebrated her 47th birthday on May 7th&#151;and Benoit Samuelson both qualified for all six Women&rsquo;s Olympic Marathon Trials, the first of which was held in 1984.</font></p>
												<p><font size="-1">In 1984, Benoit Samuelson was already the U.S. open women&rsquo;s marathon record holder, while Somers Smith was a fledgling post-college runner. Somers Smith didn&rsquo;t begin running until her junior year at the University of California, Davis where she earned All-American honors in cross country and track. After receiving a law degree, Somers Smith scored a breakthrough race at the 1989 California International Marathon where she placed second in 2:33:37. In &lsquo;93 and &lsquo;94 she earned U.S. national marathon titles. In 1995, she placed seventh (first American) at the IAAF World Championships marathon, and was ranked the #1 U.S. female marathoner on the <i>Track &amp; Field News </i>annual list.</font></p>
												<p><font size="-1">Somers Smith recorded her all-time PR of 2:30:06 at the 1996 Olympic Trials, and went on to place 31st at the Atlanta Olympic Games despite injuring an Achilles tendon during the race. She is the 22nd fastest U.S. female performer of all time.</font></p>
												<p><font size="-1">Somers Smith, an attorney, is a partner in the law firm of Duggan Smith and Hutkin, LLP in San Luis Obispo, Calif., which she founded. She practices in the areas of business and transaction law, real property, land use, business succession planning, and health care. Somers Smith is married to Steve Smith, a triathlete, and has a 23-year-old daughter, Monica.&nbsp;</font></p>
												<p><font size="-1">Sports psychologist Dr. JoAnn Dahlkoetter couldn&rsquo;t resist contacting Somers Smith after her most recent achievement to explore the mindset of this longtime distance standout.</font></p>
												<p><font size="-1"><b>Pacific Association/USATF:</b> You have now qualified for six Olympic Team Trials-Women&rsquo;s Marathons. What meaning does this have for to you to gain the 45-49 record at this year&rsquo;s Trials, eclipsing Joan Samuelson&rsquo;s mark?</font></p>
												<p><font size="-1"><b>Linda Somers Smith:</b> I enjoyed these last trials more than any other. I was relaxed, not nervous. I wanted to run 2:36, and I ran 2:38, pretty close to my goal. I knew how fit I was. I felt good throughout the race.</font></p>
												<p><font size="-1"><b>Pacific Association/USATF: </b>Is running fast more of a challenge now that you are older?</font></p>
												<p><font size="-1"><b>LSS:</b> When you&rsquo;re older something always hurts. Your body doesn&rsquo;t move the way it used to. Your arms, shoulders, legs, everything is a bit different. For instance, when I wear high heels my legs kill me. In your training it can be just one small thing that throws your body off balance. I don&rsquo;t think that the body is meant to do just running for years and years, so I balance my running with swimming.</font></p>
												<p><font size="-1"><b>Pacific Association/USATF: </b>To what do you attribute your longevity in the sport?</font></p>
												<p><font size="-1"><b>LSS:</b> I started running late, at age 20. So I didn&rsquo;t beat up my body in high school. I&rsquo;ve maintained my motivation for competing. And, I&rsquo;ve always done a lot of cross-training with swimming. That has helped my longevity.<br>
														When I train, I run as I feel. I don&rsquo;t even keep a logbook. I do what my body tells me I need to do. I like to run; it keeps me happy. And I always have a back-up sport, in case my legs aren&rsquo;t fully recovered from a running workout.<br>
														I think enjoying the training is a big part of longevity in the sport. I also love to swim. I need to cross-train to stay healthy. If I&rsquo;m injured, I get in the pool.</font></p>
												<p><font size="-1"><b>Pacific Association/USATF:</b> Did you swim competitively in school?</font></p>
												<p><font size="-1"><b>LSS:</b> I swam when I was younger on a swim team, so I can draw on that background. I do a lot of kickboard work in the pool which helps my legs recover.</font></p>
												<p><font size="-1"><b>Pacific Association/USATF:</b> Many people think Olympians are especially gifted with perfect bodies. Have you had many injuries?</font></p>
												<p><font size="-1"><b>LSS:</b> Actually I&rsquo;ve been injured frequently. I have to take a lot of breaks, so I have not had as many years of consistent running as others. There are long periods of time when I&rsquo;m recovering from an injury. You might say it&rsquo;s like a natural periodization. But I&rsquo;ve always found positive ways to deal with it and get through it.</font></p>
												<p><font size="-1"><b>Pacific Association/USATF:</b> Were there times when you thought about quitting, and how did you get through those?</font></p>
												<p><font size="-1"><b>LSS:</b> After the 2004 trials, I had lot of aches and pains. I was not liking it at all. I had two surgeries, in 2005 and 2006. I had bunion surgery on my foot, which got infected. When you can&rsquo;t use your foot you&rsquo;re very limited. I couldn&rsquo;t even swim as an alternative for a while.<br>
														Then I had problems with back pain and had surgery for that. I had to take four months off from running. At least I was fortunate to have good timing to recover in time for each Olympic period. I came back and was in good shape for the past six Olympic Trials.</font></p>
												<p><font size="-1"><b>Pacific Association/USATF:</b> Tell me about your peak experiences as an Olympian. What are the defining moments for you?</font></p>
												<p><font size="-1"><b>LSS:</b> Everybody approaches things differently. The Olympic Trials was a high pressure situation, but not the end all or be all. For me it was one high stakes performance. It felt like just a long, hard run. The Trials was a great run for me.<br>
														When I was running in the Olympics in Atlanta, though, I had a different take on it. My attitude toward the Olympic experience was colored by my injury. I tore my Achilles. It was extremely painful, a letdown for me. You train so hard for so long, and sometimes you don&rsquo;t get the results you want.</font></p>
												<p><font size="-1"><b>Pacific Association/USATF:</b> As a sports psychologist I know mental training can play a key part in a peak performance. How important do you think the mental element is in your training?</font></p>
												<p><font size="-1"><b>LSS:</b> I think the mental part is incredibly important. Running is 90 percent physical, but the way you get to be physically strong is to get strong mentally. You have to train smarter. The mental element is equally important to the physical component. It&rsquo;s a lot more subtle than the physical part, but equally important.<br>
														The biggest downfall with runners is that they sabotage themselves, for example by picking races based on prize money or running a marathon when they should be running a 10K. The U.S. is a great place. You can run anything you want. There are so many more opportunities, but there are a lot more opportunities to screw up as well.</font></p>
												<p><font size="-1"><b>Pacific Association/USATF:</b> Do you use any type of mental training techniques such as visualization or affirmations to help with performing your best?</font></p>
												<p><font size="-1"><b>LSS:</b> Yes, definitely. I visualize myself not falling back if there&rsquo;s a surge. I visualize myself relaxing during a race.</font></p>
												<p><font size="-1"><b>Pacific Association/USATF:</b> What are your favorite races?</font></p>
												<p><font size="-1"><b>LSS:</b> I&rsquo;d say my best race was the Olympic Trials. My favorite race was the World Championships in 1995 in Sweden (where Linda placed seventh - <i>Editor</i>). I had just come back from surgery. I felt really good the whole race. I was in really good shape. In that race I was going there more for the experience. It was great to be in an all-women&rsquo;s race.</font></p>
												<p><font size="-1"><b>Pacific Association/USATF:</b> What tips do you have for other athletes who might have trouble staying motivated to train and race?</font></p>
												<p><font size="-1"><b>LSS:</b> Having a routine really helps. Try to include running in your social life. It makes training much easier. Then, your friendships center around running. You can do group runs. I&rsquo;d also suggest running in the morning. That&rsquo;s the best part of the day.</font></p>
												<p><font size="-1"><b>Pacific Association/USATF:</b> What are your observations about the sport of running? Where is it going?</font></p>
												<p><font size="-1"><b>LSS:</b> I think it&rsquo;s great that so many young people are running now with awesome performances. I&rsquo;m super impressed. There&rsquo;s more organized group training available with lots of support such as Team Running USA.</font></p>
												<p><font size="-1"><b>Pacific Association/USATF:</b> What personal rewards and benefits have you gained from your running career?</font></p>
												<p><font size="-1"><b>LSS:</b> It&rsquo;s been very rewarding personally. I&rsquo;ve met a lot of great people. I&rsquo;ve gotten to travel and have fun, live a healthy lifestyle. It&rsquo;s very satisfying to have good performances. As an Olympian, I get to watch all the other Olympians. I remember the opening ceremonies of the Olympics in Atlanta. They were fantastic, except they kept us in this pen for eight hours in heat beforehand. The USA team was the last country to march out.</font></p>
												<p><font size="-1"><b>Pacific Association/USATF:</b> Do you have hobbies and other interests?</font></p>
												<p><font size="-1"><b>LSS:</b> My husband and I each have a horse in Arroyo Grande. We ride three times a week. Maybe I&rsquo;ll do a ride and tie [competition] one day.</font></p>
												<p><font size="-1"><b>Pacific Association/USATF:</b> How have PA/USATF LDR programs helped you in your development as an athlete?</font></p>
												<p><font size="-1"><b>LSS:</b> The PA/USATF LDR programs are excellent. When I lived in Northern California, that was the best thing about living there&#151;the training, the clubs, the races. Mark Winitz is a great leader in supporting these events.</font></p>
												<p><font size="-1"><b>Pacific Association/USATF:</b> With your professional career as a lawyer how do you find time for training while being a co-partner in a law practice? How do you balance your running with work and family life?</font></p>
												<p><font size="-1"><b>LSS:</b> It&rsquo;s relatively easy now. I run in the morning, then work all day. It was harder when my daughter Monica was in high school. I had to support her. Now it&rsquo;s easier. Just get a schedule and I stick to it. No matter what your schedule is, you can always work in a run. Anyone can do this!</font></p>
