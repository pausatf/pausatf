<br><b>ATHLETE QUOTES</b> 
<br>
<br>Adam Montague- junior men's javelin champion 
<br>
<br>I was reasonably happy, it's just a win. I went out there with my best. Itwasn't a PR (personal record), but my second best. My best was last year.
<br>
<br>Bo Taylor - junior men's discus champion 
<br>
<br>It feels awesome. There was pretty good wind, it kept changing direction. Any wind is good wind.
<br>
<br>Emily Bernhardt - junior women's hammer throw champion 
<br>
<br>I won the Nike Outdoor Nationals last weekend, so I was happy to come here and get my fourth national championship. I was pretty confident coming into the meet, but my first two throws weren't so good, so I just had to step it up and get into finals.
<br>
<br>Andrew Bumbalough - junior men's 5,000 meter champion 
<br>
<br>It was hot, but everybody had to deal with it. It feels good (to be a national champion). This was my first year in college. I have had my ups and downs, I redshirted indoors and now I finally got the chance to compete outdoors.
<br>
<br>Natasha LaBeaud - junior women's 5,000 meter champion 
<br>
<br>I have been planning for this, and when I didn't make it to nationals (NCAA), I needed to do something. Sometimes the heat overtakes me, I am surprised how hot it can get. I keep thinking 'So how bad do you want this?' and just keep going.
<br>
<br>Diego Mercado - junior men's 10,000 meter champion 
<br>
<br>The humdity played a part, it made it feel like we were running 66-68 seconds. It was my first 10,000 meters ever. It was phenomenal, I felt great. These are the meets that I look forward to every year. I had to play it cool and be patient. Now I know patience is a virtue.
