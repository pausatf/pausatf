TILSON, CODY RECORD VICTORIES<br>
AT KAISER PERMANENTE NAPA VALLEY MARATHON<br>
<br>
NAPA, Calif. - March 5, 2006 - Alex Tilson, 35, of Burlingame, Calif. and 
Shannon Cody, 36, of Redwood City, Calif. earned challenging wins at 
today's 28th Annual Kaiser Permanente Napa Valley Marathon. Both victors 
registered convincing titles despite rainy, and occasionally windy, 
conditions that dampened finishing times among 2,000 entrants and 1,438 
official finishers. <br>
<br>
Tilson's winning time of 2 hours, thirty-two minutes, and 17 seconds was 
over two minutes slower than his previous best marathon, but Cody's time 
of 3:02:08 was her best ever for the 26.2-mile marathon distance. Each 
winner took home titles as 2006 Road Runners Club of America (RRCA) 
national marathon champions The event served as RRCA's National Marathon 
Championship event. Tilson won five cases of premium wine donated by the 
Napa Valley Silverado Trail Wineries Association and Cody earned four 
cases. Each winner also carried home a specially produced, etched bottle 
of Napa Valley wine. <br>
<br>
Cody used her experience in ten previous marathons to run a tactically 
well-paced race. For about 16 miles of the course that runs the length of 
the scenic Napa Valley, Cody was accompanied by Suzanne Segesta (Redwood 
City, Calif.), Cody's West Valley Track Club teammate and training 
partner. Once leaving Segesta behind, Cody swept past women's leader 
Elizabeth Ben-Ishai (Ann Arbor, Mich.) at 21 miles and proceeded 
unchallenged to the finish line at Napa's Vintage High School. <br>
<br>
Ben-Ishai hung on for second place in 3:04:56. Segesta was third in 
3:07:03. <br>
<br>
"I really didn't go into this race thinking about place," said Cody, a 
fourth-grade teacher, who also won the Avenue of the Giants Marathon in 
far Northern California last May. "I had my own goal of running a 
personal record and breaking three hours. So, this was exciting for me, a 
big surprise. <br>"
<br>
For pre-race favorite Alex Tilson, who owns the U.S. 50-Kilometer road 
record (2:51: 48), topping the men's field was far from a forgone 
conclusion. The race was Tilson's first at the Napa Valley Marathon, and 
his first marathon after several years of reduced training. <br>
<br>
Yet, Tilson shed a loose front pack composed of several men by five 
miles, quickly forged a half-mile lead, and ran in fine form to an 
unchallenged finish. Duncan Larkin (Exton, Penn.) captured the runner-up 
spot in 2:36:48, over four minutes behind the winner. David Monk 
(Vacaville, Calif.) was third in 2:37:10. <br>
<br>
"It wasn't that cold or windy, but the times seemed to be off," said 
Tilson, who was bothered by a tight calf during the race. "The marathon 
is always humbling, It always hurts and always beats you up. But you 
rarely win in running, so when you do, it's nice." <br>
<br>
Jim Scattini, 42,  of Salinas, Calif. topped the masters men's age group 
in 2:44:24. Becky Backstrom, 48, from Sammamish, Wash. won the women's 
masters race in 3:11:53.
<br>
Among senior competitors, marathon and ultramarathon standout Helen 
Klein, 83, of Rancho Cordova, CA finished in 5:17:07.
<br>
Chris Houde, 46, of Carmichael, Calif. topped wheelchair competitors in 
2:50:51. <br>
<br>
The rain didn't seem to dampen the spirits of many runners. <br>
<br>
"All things considered, it wasn't a bad day," said Randy Rau, 42, of San 
Francisco, a cross country coach at St. Mary's College (Moraga, Calif.) 
who finished in 3:30:38. <br>
