FINE PERFORMANCES CAP FIFTY-PLUS 8K RUN AND BAY AREA SENIOR GAMES<br>
<br>
Fifty-Plus Honors Peggy Fleming with Zatopek Award<br>
<br>
PALO ALTO, Calif. - March 12, 2006 - The 23rd Annual Fifty-Plus Lifelong <br>
Fitness Weekend and its inaugural companion event, the Bay Area Senior <br>
Games, concluded today while showcasing the abilities of hundreds of <br>
senior athletes. Under cool conditions and drippy skies, Emil Magallanes, <br>
50, of Boise, Idaho and Heidi Swan, 52, of Larkspur, Calif. scored almost <br>
uncontested victories in the Weekend's showcase event, the Paul Spangler <br>
Memorial 8-Kilometer Run around the Stanford University campus.<br>
<br>
Magallanes' winning time was 28 minutes and 18 seconds. Swan breezed to <br>
victory in 30:42. Both runners were crowned 8K Senior Champions (ages 50 <br>
to 59) for the Pacific Association of USA Track & Field. The race serves <br>
as an 8K road championship for the Pacific Association.<br>
<br>
Both Magallanes and Swan took leads early in the race and barely looked <br>
back. They soundly thumped the competition among 151 finishers in the <br>
featured event of the day -- the 8K Championship for runners age 50 and <br>
over.<br>
<br>
"My plan was just to see how the race shaped up and run my own race. I <br>
felt confident since I've been doing a lot of track workouts," said <br>
Magallanes who is planning to compete in the mile and 3,000-meter events <br>
at the USA Masters Indoor Track and Field Championship in Boston. March <br>
24 through 26. <br>
<br>
Behind Magallanes, Fletcher Lesley, 50, of San Francisco, and Lloyd <br>
Stephenson, 51, also of San Francisco, registered a close race for the <br>
runner-up spot. Lesley finished second in 29:06 with Stephenson third in <br>
29:11.<br>
<br>
Swan captured the women's crown following impressive age 50-and-over <br>
victories last fall at the USA Track & Field National Masters 10K <br>
Championships, and the Pacific Association/USATF Half Marathon and <br>
30-Kilometer Championships, making her one of the premier U.S. female <br>
runners in the age 50-54 division. Swan's 30:42 time at today's race puts <br>
her among the top half dozen U.S. 8K performers of all time in her <br>
division.<br>
<br>
Kim Rupert, 51, of Hillsborough, Calif. secured second place in 33:09. <br>
Karen Kunz, 51, of Folsom, Calif. was third in 33:23<br>
<br>
The oldest finishers in the seniors' race were Harold Thurston, 87, of <br>
Los Altos, Calif., who notched a 55:01 finishing time (11 minutes per <br>
mile pace) and 79-year-old Joy Johnson of San Jose, Calif. who ran 52:44. <br>
The all-time oldest finisher in the race's record book is Dr. Paul <br>
Spangler, the veteran, multi-age-group record holder to whom the event <br>
serves as a memorial. Spangler last competed at the Fifty-Plus race in <br>
1993 just before his death at the age of 94.<br>
<br>
In the separate 8K race for runners under age 50 -- which also served as <br>
a Pacific Association/USATF Championship -- Kevin Pierpoint, 30, of Palo <br>
Alto, Calif. and Magdalena Lewy Boulet, 32, of Oakland, Calif. emerged <br>
respectively as the men's and women's champions. Pierpoint scored a <br>
winning time of 25:15. Lewy Boulet finished in 27:36. Sissel <br>
Berntsen-Heber (Mill Valley, Calif.) and Jose Aispuro (Freedom, Calif.) <br>
pinned down the masters (age 40-49) wins.<br>
<br>
The winners of the companion 5-Kilometer Race Walk were Jack Bray, 73, of <br>
Kentfield, Calif. in 28:33, and Leslie Sokol, 48, of San Jose, Calif. in <br>
28:49.<br>
<br>
In conjunction with the Weekend, Fifty-Plus Lifelong Fitness also <br>
conducted the first-ever Bay Area Senior Games today, which offered a <br>
multitude of athletic events including track and field, swimming, tennis, <br>
and table tennis -- all for senior athletes.<br>
<br>
Top performers in the track and field competition included: Nadine <br>
O'Connor (age 64, 100 meters, 14.22), Cherrie Sherrard (age 68, shot put, <br>
26 feet, 4 inches), Larry Lettieri (age 58, 100 meters, 12.43), Roger <br>
Tsuda (age 71, 100 meters, 14.00), and Matthew Pruitt (age 58) who won <br>
both the 200-meter (26.26) and 400-meter (59.87) dashes in his age <br>
division. <br>
<br>
Several players stood out in the table tennis competition. Byng Forsberg, <br>
80, won his 80s division in the individual round-robin tournament. <br>
According to competition director, Dennis Davis, Forsberg might have <br>
beaten most of the other 25 competitors as well if he had an opportunity <br>
to play against them. Lee Swander, 65, topped his table tennis age <br>
division in both singles and doubles competition, and served as a <br>
tournament volunteer.<br>
<br>
Also at the Weekend's festivities, 1968 Olympic figure skating gold <br>
medalist Peggy Fleming was honored as the 16th recipient of the Annual <br>
Emil Zatopek Award bestowed by Fifty-Plus Lifelong Fitness. The honor, <br>
named after the splendid Czech Olympic distance runner, is awarded to <br>
individuals who have attained notable achievements in sports, and in <br>
doing so have inspired others to live a healthy lifestyle.<br>
<br>
"Through my skating, I've learned so much about myself. My sport taught <br>
me what I could do with my talents, whether in the rink or in the rest of <br>
my life," said Fleming in an acceptance speech of the Zatopek Award at <br>
the Fifty-Plus Annual Awards Dinner on Saturday. "I think exercise tests <br>
us in so many ways, our skills, our hearts, our ability to bounce back <br>
after setbacks. This is the inner beauty of sports and competition, and <br>
it can serve us all well as adult athletes."<br>
<br>
Additional honors awarded at the dinner: Cheryl Sinclair of Pacifica, <br>
Calif. received the 2006 Fifty-Plus Ambassador of the Year Award. Dottie <br>
Phillips of Sunnyvale, Calif. was the recipient of the organization's <br>
Volunteer of the Year Award.<br>
