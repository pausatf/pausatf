Credit a bit of childhood rivalry for sparking Junior Olympian Atiya Harvey’s interest in running. 
<p>The 12-year-old member of the <b>Mission Valley Track Club</b> used to race and beat her cousin at family get-togethers.
<p>	“My uncle told me I ought to join a track club because I was so fast,” says the Hayward resident.
<p>	That was four years ago. 

<p>Since then, Harvey qualified for the 2003 Junior Olympics in Miami in the 100-meter dash, 200-meter dash and 4x100 bantam girls relay. The relay team&#151;comprising Alesha Blair, Jazmin Harper, Ciarra Brewer and Harvey&#151;took the gold with a time of 55:13.
<p>	Harvey returned to the 2004 Junior Olympics in Eugene, Ore., as a bantam, winning the 100-meter dash in 13.20. She placed second in the 200 with 26.61.
<p>	She once again qualified for JOs in 2005 at the Regional 14 meet in Livermore, this time as a midget. She won both the 100 meters in 12.84 and the 200 meters in 26.60.
<p>	As a second-year midget this year, Harvey is on target to have another stellar season, says Mission Valley Track Club coach Jeff Prothro.
<p>	She showed her prowess at the Modesto Relays, May 7, by handily winning the 100-meter dash in 12.81.
<p>	But Prothro says they’re not forgetting her other event, the 200 meters.
<p>	“We’re putting a big focus on the 200,” Prothro says. “We’re doing more of a strength workout. We normally focus on speed work, but this year, we have changed things.”
<p>	The strength workouts also involve running 400 meters, which Prothro says will make Harvey a tougher 200-meter runner. But Harvey may may not be quite as enthusiastic about the new plan.
<p>	“She gives me an ugly look every time they call the 400,” Prothro says, smiling.
