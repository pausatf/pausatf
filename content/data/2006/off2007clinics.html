<b>CLINICS FOR 2007</b><br>
<br>
Official's clinics for both the new official and the veteran are normally held in January and February.  If you have a group of five or more people who would like to learn more about officiating, you can contact: <br>
George Kleeman<br>
925-229-2927<br>
<a href="mailto:georgeklee@aol.com"> georgeklee@aol.com</a><br>
to schedule a special clinic. <br>
<br>  
The cost for clinics out of the winter period will depend on what type of clinic you would like to have. <br>
<br> 
Our Level I Introduction to Officiating Clinic is given most weekends in January.  There are three introductory clinics, one each for track & field, race walking and long distance running/cross country. Each runs the whole day and instructs you about how to officiate one or more the athletic disciplines named above. Clinics generally cover all rulebooks. Cost of the clinic includes a copy of the USATF rulebook; at the end of the day, the clinic student will be certified as an Association-level USATF official.<br>
<br>
Level I clinics cost $25 for pre-enrollment; or $30 on the day of the clinic. <br>
<br>
Level II clinics focus on specific events and disciplines, such as throws, high jump, weights-and-measures, marshalling, etc., and are designed for (but not limited to) officials with at least one year's experience. Costs vary.
We are looking for suggestions on topics to be covered in Level II clinics in 2007; also for volunteers to teach Level II clinics. <br>
