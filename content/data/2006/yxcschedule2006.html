<b>PACIFIC ASSOCIATION/UNITED STATES OF AMERICA TRACK & FIELD

2006 YOUTH CROSS COUNTRY</b>



At our annual meeting on June 24th we discussed and agreed upon three items:

1) The Region 14/Junior Olympics Qualifying Meet will, once again, take 

place the day after the California High School (CIF) State Championships.  

The meet will be on Sunday, November 26th, at Woodward Park in Fresno.

2) We did the bidding for our cross country schedule.  One big change is 

that the PA/JOs and the Region 14/JOs will be two weeks apart instead of 

the normal one week apart.  The complete schedule is listed below.

3) Our point scoring system for meets leading up to the Pacific Association/Junior 

Olympics Qualifying Meet will again be in effect this season.



We will be hosting nine (9) meets, between September 23rd and November 19th, 

before the Region 14 Junior Olympic.  We will have a scoring system at seven 

(7) of those meets for boys and girls in the Bantam, Midget and Youth age groups.  

At each meet, if you come in 1st in your age group you will receive 10 point, 

2nd =9, 3rd =8, etc.  At our November 12th PA/JO Championships the athletes who 

have scored the most points in each of the six age group will be presented with 

a trophy and a whole lot of recognition.   The athletes who have scored the 2nd, 

3rd, 4th & 5th most points will receive a letter of accomplishment and recognition.  



We would like to have as many of our athletes and clubs take part in all of our meets.  

It supports the clubs that host the meets and it makes our athletes better in competition.  

The more the athletes, the better the competition.  And the better the competition, 

the better the athletes will be.



Not all athletes in your club are good sprinters or good throwers or good jumpers.  

Some of them could be good distance runners.  If your club is not involved in cross 

country give it a try!  The coaching is a lot easier than track and field as there is 

only one event!  Or, if your club is not involved in cross country, your athletes may 

legally take part in cross country with another club.



INFORMATION LEADING UP TO EACH MEET WILL APPEAR ON THE PACIFIC ASSOCIATION WEBSITE.  

WHEN YOU HAVE WWW.PAUSATF.ORG, CLICK ON ‘YOUTH’, CLICK ON ‘CROSS COUNTRY SCHEDULE’ 

AND SLIDE DOWN TO THE MEET YOU WANT.  THEN, CLICK AT THE BLUE LINE.
