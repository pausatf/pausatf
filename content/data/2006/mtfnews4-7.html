eastern part of the country would fare well in the final club scoring.

club scoring (men's and women's points combined) and also led the way in
men's and women's club scoring race. <br> 
<br>
With a total of 91 clubs scoring points during three days of competition
that ended on March 26, So Cal TC-Fleet Feet (Southern California)
claimed the overall club title with 309 points. Finishing second and
third were, Brooks-Fleet Feet Racing <b> (Pacific Association) </b>  with 192
points and So. Calif. Striders T.C. (Southern California) with 137
points. <br>
