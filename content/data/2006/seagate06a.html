<br><b>APPLIED MATERIALS SILICON VALLEY TURKEY TROT / SEAGATE 5K
<br>ANNOUNCES WORLD CLASS ELITE FIELD</b>

<br><br>SAN JOSE, Calif. - (November 17, 2006) - When the Applied Materials 
<br>Silicon Valley Turkey Trot 5K/10K and its companion Seagate Elite 5K road 
<br>race showcase their new downtown venue at San Jose's Confluence Park 
<br>East, the event will bring together a confluence of healthy activities 
<br>for the entire community on Thanksgiving morning. Plus, in only its 
<br>second year, the soon-to-become San Jose fixture is expected to draw 
<br>3,000 participants, and a superb field of world class and nationally 
<br>ranked distance runners who will vie for a prize purse of more than 
<br>$22,000. For local and regional class competitors, this year's Turkey 
<br>Trot/Seagate 5K will host the Pacific Association/USA Track & Field Open 
<br>Men's 5K Championship presented by Santa Clara Valley National Bank.

<br><br>Event organizers will roll out a spacious, new staging area adjacent to 
<br>HP Pavilion. Redesigned race courses include a fast, spectator-friendly 
<br>3/4-mile loop which runners in the Seagate Elite 5K race will negotiate 
<br>four times; and a pleasant route, which includes portions of the 
<br>tree-lined Guadalupe River Park Trail for recreational runners in the 
<br>Applied Materials Silicon Valley 10K (6.2 miles) Run and 5K (3.1 miles) 
<br>Run/Walk.

<br><br>Incorporated into the 5K Run/Walk are "SAP CEO/Celebrity," "KB Home 
<br>Quickest Cop/Fastest Firefighter," and "EMC2 Fittest Firm" divisions. A 
<br>Kid's Fun Run, sponsored by Lucile Packard Children's Hospital, for two 
<br>to nine year-old children, encourages the whole family to participate.

<br><br>All events start and finish in downtown San Jose at Confluence Park East 
<br>on the Guadalupe River (intersection of West St. John and Autumn 
<br>Streets). The events begin at 9:00 a.m. and run through the morning. U.S. 
<br>Congressman Mike Honda, who represents California's 15th congressional 
<br>district (Santa Clara and Santa Cruz counties), will serve as Grand 
<br>Marshal.

<br><br>Best of all, the Applied Materials Silicon Valley Turkey Trot - Run or 
<br>Walk for Health, Hope, and a Home benefits several local charities: Santa 
<br>Clara Family Health Foundation, Second Harvest Food Bank, and the Housing 
<br>Trust of Santa Clara County. In 2005, its inaugural year, the Turkey Trot 
<br>raised over $132,000 for these charities.

<br><br>"We all know families less fortunate than our own," said Silicon Valley 
<br>Leadership Group CEO and race founder Carl Guardino. "The Turkey Trot is 
<br>a fun and healthy way for families to kick-start the holidays by helping 
<br>themselves while helping others. Already, we expect to substantially 
<br>surpass last year's charitable contributions."

<br><br>According to an annual survey conducted by USA Track & Field, the 
<br>national governing body of track and field, road runners and walkers in 
<br>the U.S. raised approximately $656 million for charitable causes in 2005, 
<br>a 14 percent increase over the previous year, and the largest increase 
<br>ever since the survey began in 2002. In 2005, 83 percent of races 
<br>nationwide raised money for charity.

<br><br>REGISTRATION

<br><br>More information, including registration forms and online registration, 
<br>is available at www.svlg.net, or call the race hotline: (408) 501-7864.

<br><br>TOP ELITE FIELDS ANNOUNCED

<br><br>Turkey Trot participants and visiting spectators will enjoy watching a 
<br>Thanksgiving parade of invited professional athletes representing ten 
<br>nations in the separate men's and women's Seagate Elite 5K races which 
<br>follow the "all comers" events. The invitational race, particularly on 
<br>the men's side, is shaping up as one of the most competitive 5Ks in the 
<br>U.S. this year.

<br><br>The deep men's field includes three Olympians, an NCAA (collegiate) 
<br>10,000-meter national champion, and more than a dozen athletes who have 
<br>run under 14 minutes for the 5K distance. The women's race features 
<br>several of the most promising and swift young distance runners in the 
<br>world, one Olympian, and national champions and medalists.

<br><br>The top three men and women will earn $2,500, $1,500, and $500 
<br>respectively. $5,000 bonuses are up for grabs for the male and/or female 
<br>who betters the current U.S. 5K road records. The current U.S. records 
<br>are held by two Californians: Marc Davis (13 minutes and 24 seconds set 
<br>in 1996), and Deena Kastor (Drossin) (14:54, 2002).

<br><br>Blake Boldon, 27, a coach at Iowa State University, returns to defend his 
<br>men's title. Boldon, who topped an excellent men's field last year with a 
<br>14:16 win, is coming off a successful track season. This year, however, 
<br>Boldon will have much stiffer competition: Dan Browne, 31, of Beaverton, 
<br>Ore. placed 12th for the U.S. in the 2004 Olympic Games 10,000-meter race 
<br>in Athens. Browne also shares the fastest 5K time (13:16) among the 
<br>invited men with Ryan Hall, a former Stanford University All-American and 
<br>NCAA 5,000-meter champion.

<br><br>Hall, 24, has registered a sensational racing year. Last winter, Hall 
<br>earned the men's title at the USA National Cross Country Championships 
<br>and, subsequently, led the U.S. men's long course team at the IAAF World 
<br>Cross Country Championships in Japan. Last month, Hall set a new U.S. 
<br>20-kilometer record (57:54), while again leading the U.S. men's team at 
<br>the IAAF World Road Running Championships in Hungary. Hall's performances 
<br>have led to a nomination for USA Track and Field's 2006 Robert E. DeCelle 
<br>Award, bestowed annually to the outstanding U.S. male long distance 
<br>runner (award winner to be announced in December).

<br><br>Three-time NCAA individual champion (for Stanford University) Gabe 
<br>Jennings, 27, of Mendocino, Calif., who competed in the 2000 Olympic 
<br>Games at 1,500 meters, brings a honed middle distance runner's finishing 
<br>kick to the Seagate Elite 5K. Uganda's Julius Achon, a 1996 and 2000 
<br>Olympian at 1,500 meters, holds Ugandan national records at distances 
<br>from 800 meters to the mile. 

<br><br>Kenya's Josphat Boit is a likely contender for top honors. Boit, 22, is 
<br>just starting a promising post-collegiate running career after becoming 
<br>the 2006 NCAA Division I 10,000-meter national champion while competing 
<br>for Arkansas. Former University of California-Berkeley All-American 
<br>Bolota Asmerom (USA, Oakland), Celedonio (Cele) Rodriguez (USA, 
<br>Colorado), who was top American at this year's Bay to Breakers race, and 
<br>Mexico's Juan Luis Barrios (who has run 13:27 for 5,000-meters) will also 
<br>be in the hunt.

<br><br>In addition, the Pacific Association USATF Open Men's 5K Championship 
<br>division will draw the best male distance runners and club teams in the 
<br>Pacific Association (northern California and northwestern Nevada) region. 
<br>PA/USATF individuals and club teams will contend for a dedicated $2,500 
<br>prize purse plus precious Grand Prix points on the PA/USATF road circuit.

<br><br>The women's elite field is also packed with top talent. Sara Hall (former 
<br>Stanford standout Sara Bei) has had a breakout year similar to her 
<br>husband Ryan's. In September, Hall won the USA National 5K Women's Road 
<br>Championships in Providence, RI in 15:40. The 23-year-old rising star 
<br>also topped a superb international field at the Continental Airlines 
<br>Fifth Avenue Mile in New York City on September 30th. Hall's personal 
<br>best at 5,000-meters is 15:24.

<br><br>"We're really excited about racing in San Jose and then spending the 
<br>Thanksgiving holiday with my family in Santa Rosa," said Hall, who was a 
<br>prep standout at Santa Rosa's Montgomery High School.

<br><br>Hall's former Stanford teammate, Malindi Elmore, 26, a 2004 Olympian at 
<br>1,500 meters for Canada, carries an impressive 4:02 personal best in the 
<br>metric mile to San Jose. Jenelle Deatherage, 29, of Team USA Minnesota 
<br>also has impressive middle distance credentials. Deatherage placed third 
<br>at 1,500 meters at this year's USA Indoor Track and Field Championships, 
<br>and was eighth outdoors. Romania's Adriana Pirtea brings a strong 15:36 
<br>personal best at 5K to the race.

<br><br>All eyes, perhaps, will be on young Kenyan Emily Chebet, who, at 20 years 
<br>old, appears poised to enter top international ranks. Last summer, Chebet 
<br>placed high in two of the most talent-laden track and field meets (for 
<br>distance runners) in the world. After scoring a runner-up 10,000-meter 
<br>performance (32:27) at the Kenyan National Track & Field Championships, 
<br>Chebet ran a lightening swift 31:33 for 10K while winning a bronze medal 
<br>at the African Athletics Championships.

<br><br>Kenya's Magdalene Mukunzi (15:38 for 5,000m) will appear following a 
<br>string of excellent performances which include a course record 25:24 at 
<br>the NTELOS 8K in Richmond, Va. last weekend and a third-place at the Rock 
<br>'n' Roll Half Marathon in San Jose on October 8th.

<br><br>Newly turned master Sylvia Mosqueda, 40, of Los Angeles, will also join 
<br>the women's field. Mosqueda, who owns a lifetime personal best of 15:30 
<br>for 5K, won the USA Masters National 10K road title in Paso Robles, 
<br>Calif. on September 24th.

<br><br>The top women will have their targets set on the women's race record of 
<br>16:01, set in last year's inaugural event by Blake Russell, who will not 
<br>defend her title. A full list of top elite contenders is shown below.

<br><br>For Dan Browne, the Turkey Trot's Seagate 5K fits perfectly into his 
<br>schedule which is focused on making a second consecutive U.S. Olympic 
<br>team in 2008.

<br><br>"I'm definitely hoping it will kick off a successful winter racing season 
<br>for me," said Browne, a West Point graduate who is coached by U.S. 
<br>marathon record holder Alberto Salazar. "I'm healthy, building great 
<br>mileage and core strength, and getting in 16 miles a day."

<br><br>As for a possible new U.S. 5K national record on the fast and flat San 
<br>Jose course?

<br><br>Browne said a record effort takes ideal conditions: a fast course, a 
<br>solid elite field, proper prize money incentives, and, most importantly, 
<br>racers who are willing to put it on the line with a fast pace.

<br><br>The Silicon Valley Leadership Group, South Bay Labor Council/Working 
<br>Partnerships, City of San Jose, and Santa Clara County are partnering to 
<br>present the 2006 Applied Materials Silicon Valley Turkey Trot and 
<br>companion events.
