INDIANAPOLIS - Ryan Hall has been named USA Track and Field's Athlete of
the Week after winning the open men's 12 km race on Sunday at the 2006
USA Cross Country Championships, at Van Cortland Park in New York.<br>

The 2005 USA Outdoor bronze medalist at 5,000m, Hall finished the race
in 34 minutes, 38 seconds -- 27 seconds ahead of runner-up Jorge Torres.
The previous day Hall placed fourth in the open men's 4 km race in
10:57. With his first and third place finishes, Hall is eligible to
compete at the World Cross Country Championships in Fukuoka, Japan in
