<b> Call for LDR Officials for PA LDR Grand Prix Events</b><br>
<br>
Pacific Association LDR Officials (and track Officials who serve LDR): <br>
<br>
The 2006 PA/USATF Road Grand Prix will begin in a few weeks. That means
we're again seeking your generous volunteer assistance at all of our road
Championship/Grand Prix events. <br>
<br>
The 2006 schedule is below. Full schedule details are available online at:
<br>
www.pausatf.org/data/2005/RRschedule2005.html<br>
<br>
If you'd like to serve at any of these events, please let me know. Also,
if you'd like to serve on a standby Jury of Appeal for the entire season
(to be called upon as needed), I'd like to know. <br>
<br>
In the past year or so, the steady growth in numbers of our LDR officials
has allowed us to field multiple officials at many of our LDR
events--rather than relying on a single individual wearing multiple
officiating hats. I like this trend! Please welcome the following veteran
officials who recently took the LDR officials' plunge at our clinics to
bolster our ranks: Dennis Anderson, Thelma Brafford, Lorri Coppola, Rory
Osborne, Ajay Padgaonkar, Bob Rauch, Margaret Sheehan, and David Soeth.
Also, greetings to brand new USATF official (LDR) Vicky Boyd. <br>
<br>
Finally, as part of the PA/USATF Officials Committee's mentoring program,
we will be offering, whenever possible, on-the-job training for LDR
officials this year. In particular, novice LDR officials take note: If
you feel that your skills in a particular LDR officials' role (umpire,
judge, referee starter, etc.) need honing, we'll pair you with
experienced officials at particular events who have volunteered as
mentors. Please let me know if you're interested in being mentored, or
serving as a mentor! <br>
<br>
Note for LDR referees: At our LDR Referee's clinic in Davis last month, a
group of us put together a draft of an "LDR Referee's Checklist/Job
Guide." When it's complete--hopefully, within a month--it should serve as
an invaluable on-the-job tool and refresher. <br>
<br>
I look forward to working together again in 2006. Your volunteer support
ensures that our PA/USATF LDR and cross country circuits remain the very
best association LDR programs in the nation. <br>
<br>
