<b>LDR Officials (and prospective LDR Officials):</b><br>
<br>
Providing we have enough interest, we will have three clinics
specifically for LDR officials in January, as listed below. In order to
actually hold a clinic, we must have a minimum of 5 attendees for a
clinic. Please help by doing the following: <br>
<br>
-- If you or a friend plans on attending an LDR officials clinic, please
let me know ASAP so we can plan appropriately, Then REGISTER for the
clinic by visiting the Pacific  Association website at: www.pausatf.org
(select "Officials" and then  "Clinics"). Without 5 preregistrants for a
particular clinic, we will have to cancel it. <br>
<br>
-- Promote the benefits and personal rewards of becoming a PA/USATF
official and encourage your friends and acquaintances to become an LDR
official by attending an introductory clinic (San Francisco, Jan. 7 or
Davis, Jan. 21). <br>
<br>
-- Consider attending the LDR Referee clinic (Davis, Jan. 21). This
clinic, for current and new LDR Referees, will be stimulating with an
emphasis on hands-on problem solving. It will concentrate on two areas: <br>
<br>
       (1) Creation of an LDR Referee's "Toolkit/Checklist" as a hands-on
job aid for field use when preparing to referee an LDR event<br>
<br>
        (2) An interactive "problem solving" session where LDR officials
break up into small group and tackle "case studies" of Referee
situations. (What would you do, how would you rule, if this situation
came up in a race?) Each group then discusses their "solutions" for their
assigned case study with the entire class (which can comment on and
critique the solution). (Of course, each group must reference specific
sections of the rule book as part of their solutions!) <br>
<br>
The Referee's clinic, in particular, will require planning and
development of instructional materials by the instructors--so, if you
plan to attend (and I hope you do) please let me know now and REGISTER.
If enough folks in a geographic area are interested in attending, we will
organize carpools to Davis. <br>
