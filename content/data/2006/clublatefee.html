<b>Late Fee Implemented For Club Membership Renewals Received After May 1</b><br>
<br>
Clubs are reminded that starting this year a $100 late fee will be
charged if your club's membership is not renewed prior to May 1.<br>
<br>
This late fee only applies to renewing competitive clubs. Organizational
memberships (event organizers, timing companies, corporations, etc.) and
clubs who do not have athletes representing the club in sanctioned
competitions are exempt from this late fee but still encouraged to renew
their membership now.  The late fee is in addition to the annual club
membership fee. <br>
<br> 
If you have not renewed your club membership please visit
www.usatf.org/clubs/application/download/ and download a club
application today.
