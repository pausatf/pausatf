<p> <b>Zippy Time Bonuses</b><br>
	<br>
	In addition to the standard PA prize money, the Zippy 5K on Sunday, April
23, is offering bonuses to a winning PA male who breaks 14:30 and winning
PA female who breaks the course record of 16:52. The bonus is calculated
as $20 per second (male)/$25 per second (female) under these time
standards, up to $500. (The bonus increases $5 every time the standard is
broken--and the faster time becomes the new standard.)
