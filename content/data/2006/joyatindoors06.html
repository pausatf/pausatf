Indoor Champs <br>
<br>
BOSTON - <br> 
In exhibition events, the Central Park Track Club won the women's<br>
distance medley relay in 11:53.19, The Farm Team won the men's DMR<br>
(9:46.98), <b>Joy Upshaw-Margerum</b> took the masters women's 200 meters<br>
(26.57) and David Jones won the men's (23.30).<br>
<br>
<br>
Barber, Trammell take Visa Championship titles at AT&T USA<br>
The lead changed hands midway through the day, but in the end,<br>
sprinter Lisa Barber came back to win the women's Visa Championship<br>
Sunday at the AT&T USA Indoor Track & Field Championships. Hurdler<br>
Terrence Trammell's world-leading time in the men's 60-meter hurdles<br>
gave him the men's Visa Championship over shot putter Reese Hoffa, the<br>
series-long leader.<br>
<br>
For their championship performances, Barber and Trammell each won<br>
$25,000 from Visa to support their Olympic journeys.<br>
<br>
Barber comes from behind to win women's title <br>
<br>
Barber's victory was hard-earned. She had led the Race for the<br>
Championship since week 1, the Reebok Boston Indoor Games, when her time<br>
of 7.09 seconds in the women's 60m earned her 1,203 points. But on<br>
Sunday, 2005 Outdoor Visa Championship Series winner Sanya Richards<br>
briefly wrested the lead from Barber when she clocked 51.26 seconds to<br>
win the women's 400 meters and score 1,210 points. <br>
<br>
Barber had the last card to play in the final race of the day. The 2005<br>
USA Outdoor 100m champion ran 7.06 seconds to win the AT&T women's 60<br>
meters, scoring 1,212 points in the Race for the Championship. In the 60<br>
she held off 2005 World Outdoor 100m champion Lauryn Williams (7.11) and<br>
2003 World Outdoor 100m champion Torri Edwards (7.12) to win the race. <br>
<br>
Barber had also posted a speedy time of 7.05 in the semifinal, but only<br>
performances in final races were eligible for the Visa Championship.<br>
Barber came through in the final, running exactly the time she needed to<br>
win the overall title.<br>
<br>
Trammell wins title; nearly doubles his pleasure <br>
<br>
Reese Hoffa's shot put of 21.65m/71-0.5 (1,219 points) at the 99th<br>
Millrose Games stood up as the men's Visa Championship Series leader<br>
until the penultimate men's event of the AT&T USA Indoor Championships. <br>
<br>
Two-time Olympic silver medalist Terrence Trammell's win in the men's<br>
60-meter hurdles on Sunday took the prize out of Hoffa's hands.<br>
Trammell's wire-to-wire win in 7.46 seconds over Dominique Arnold (7.51)<br>
gave him 1,123 points and the overall Visa Championship.<br>
<br>
Trammell came within .01 second of being the first man ever to win the<br>
60 hurdles-60 dash double, finishing just behind Leonard Scott in the<br>
Hershey's men's 60 meter dash, the final men's event of the meet. Scott<br>
won the race in a world-leading time of 6.52, with Trammell matching the<br>
previous world leader with 6.53.<br>
<br>
Men's 400 drama <br>
<br>
The closest race of the day was the men's 400 meters. In the first of<br>
two timed sections, 2006 world leader Milton Campbell (46.17) held off<br>
2003 World Indoor champion Tyree Washington (46.18). In the second<br>
section, LaShawn Merritt led nearly wire-to-wire, posting an identical<br>
time to Campbell of 46.17, with Wallace Spearmon second in the section<br>
in 46.67. Campbell was declared the 400m winner when his electronic time<br>
was a scant 2 thousandths of a second (.002) fasters than Merritt's -<br>
46.167 to 46.169.<br>
<br>
Danielle Carruthers successfully defended her national indoor title in<br>
the women's 60-meter hurdles, her time of 7.93 seconds putting her ahead<br>
of Damu Cherry in second (7.95). Olympic gold medalist Joanna Hayes went<br>
down in the semifinals with an apparent leg injury and did not compete<br>
in the final.<br>
<br>
In a closely contested men's 800 meters, USA Outdoor champion Khadevis<br>
Robinson held off 2003 World Indoor champion David Krummenacker as the<br>
two posted the #2 (1:46.98) and #3 (1:47.25) times by Americans this<br>
year. Robinson's mark also set a Reggie Lewis Center facility record.<br>
<br>
More winners <br>
<br>
Outdoor American record holder Tiombe Hurd won the women's triple jump<br>
with a U.S.-leading mark of 13.89m/45-7, and Shani Marks was second at<br>
13.64m/44-9. Alice Schmidt likewise posted a U.S. leader in winning the<br>
women's 800m (2:01.93) over Frances Santin (2:03.51). Other winners<br>
included Kellie Suttle in the women's pole vault (4.55m/14-11) with<br>
Jillian Schwartz second with the same height; and Joanne Dow won the<br>
women's 3,000m race walk (12:45.05) with Jolene Moore second (13:03.90).<br>
