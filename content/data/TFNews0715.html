<h2>Olympic trials News 7/15/04</h2>
 SACRAMENTO, Calif. - Marion Jones secured a spot on her second Olympic 
Team Thursday night by dominating the women's long jump at the 2004 U.S. 
Olympic Track & Field Trials as records fell in the men's and women's steeplechase.
 
Jones opened with a strong jump of 6.80m/22-3.75, which guaranteed her a
spot on the team with her very first attempt. She quieted all critics with
her second-attempt jump of 7.11m/23-4, which vaulted her from sixth to
fourth on the 2004 world list, behind only the high-altitude jump of
7.16m/23-6 by Elva Goulbourne of Jamaica. It was the best jump by an
American since Jones soared 7.13m/23-4.75 to win the Grand Prix Final in
Moscow on Sept. 5, 1998. It also was just one-half inch off Jackie
Joyner-Kersee's U.S. Championships record of 7.12m/23-4.5
 
<b>Grace Upshaw</b>, the 2003 U.S. outdoor champion, posted a mark of 
6.77m/22-2.5 on her second jump to move into second place. Akiba McKinney was third at
6.57m/21-6.75 and will be placed in the third roster spot, while Rose
Richmond will be the alternate, in fourth at 6.56m/21-6.25. Neither 
McKinney nor Richmond has the Olympic A standard of 6.70 meters/22-11.75, and they
will need to achieve it in order to compete at the Olympic Games. If
McKinney gets the standard, she will compete regardless of whether 
Richmond also makes the standard. If McKinney does not meet the standard but 
Richmond does, Richmond will fill the third roster spot.
 
The final races of the evening provided a pair of records. First, Ann
Gaffigan of Nebraska ran to a solo American record in the women's
steeplechase. Her time of 9:39.35 breaks Elizabeth Jackson's previous AR 
of 9:41.94, set in 2001, as well as Jackson's U.S. championships record.
Kathryn Anderson of Brigham Young was second in 9:45.52, with Carrie 
Messner third in 9:50.70. Although the women's steeple is not an Olympic event, 
the race was a U.S. championship event.
  
The men's competitors then took the track to vie for Olympic berths.
Three-time NCAA champion Daniel Lincoln pulled away from 2001 World
University Games champion Anthony Famiglietti and 1999 U.S. runner up 
Robert Gary in the final lap meters of the race. Lincoln's personal best time of
8:15.02 broke Hall of Famer Henry Marsh's Olympic Trials record of 
8:15.68, set in 1980, is the fastest time by an American since 2001, and also break
Pascal Dobert's 8:15.77 U.S. Championships record from 2000. Famiglietti 
was second in 8:17.91, with Gary third in 8:19.46. Both were personal-best
times.
 
NCAA champion Jeremy Wariner of Baylor continued his impressive season 
with a 2004 world-leading time and personal best of 44.37 in the men's 400
meters. Coached by Clyde Hart, who guided Michael Johnson to one of the 
most impressive careers in the history of track & field, the 20-year-old 
Wariner pulled well clear of the field in the final straight. Finishing well back 
in second was 2003 NCAA runner-up Otis Harris in 44.67, with two-time world
championships 4x400m relay gold medalist Derrick Brew finishing third in
44.68. Wariner's Baylor teammate, Darrold Williamson, finished just .01
second from joining Wariner on the Olympic Team, placing fourth in 44.70.
 
The women's 400m final promises to be equally youthful as the men's final.
Nineteen-year-old American junior record holder Sanya Richards ran the
fastest semifinal time Thursday, 50.34 seconds, while 21-year-old NCAA
champion Dee Dee Trotter from Tennessee won the other semifinal in 50.53
seconds. UCLA's 21-year-old NCAA runner-up, Monique Henderson, was second 
in the race in an identical time of 50.53.
 
American record holder Erin Gilreath added the title of Olympic Trials
champion to her resume as she unleashed a first-round throw of 
69.27m/227-3, giving her all the distance she would need to win the event. She improved
her final mark to 70.42m/231-00 on her fourth throw for good measure. 
Former American record holder Anna Mahon was second with 69.23m/227-1, and Amber
Campbell of Coastal Carolina was third with 65.98m/216-6. Because Campbell
does not have the Olympic A standard of 67.50m/221-5, fourth-place 
finisher Jackie Jeschelnig 65.15/213-9 will fill the third spot on the Olympic Team.
  
Kenta Bell, the #3 jumper in the world this year, posted the top mark in
men's triple jump qualifying. Bell jumped 17.47m/57-3.75 - just two
centimeters off his 2004 and personal best of 17.49m/57-4.75. Two-time 
NCAA champion and 2000 Olympian Walter Davis (17.36m/56-11.5), and fellow
Olympian and former NCAA champion Melvin Lister (17.08m/56-0.5) also 
soared over 56 feet and lead a very strong field into Saturday's final.
  
Four-time U.S. champion Breaux Greer needed just one throw to advance to 
the final on Saturday, chucking the spear 79.19m/259-10 on his first attempt 
to post the best mark of the day. 2003 U.S. indoor and outdoor champion 
Kristin Heaston had the best mark in women's shot put qualifying with 17.93m/58-10
on her first and only throw. 2004 U.S. indoor champion and NCAA champion
Laura Gerraughty of North Carolina was second at 17.75m/58-3; the final in
the event is Friday.
 
Michael Stember (3:41.65), Alan Webb (3:47.10) and Said Ahmed (3:41.81) 
won their first-round heats of the men's 1,500m to advance to Friday's
semifinals.
  
Ten men, including 1996 Olympic gold medalist Charles Austin, world junior
champion Andra Manson, current U.S. champion Jamie Nieto, and past 
champion Nathan Leeper, all cleared 2.24m/7-4.25 to advance to Sunday's final. Also
advancing were seven jumpers at 2.20m/7.25.
  
Friday's scheduled events include finals in the women's shot put, men's
5,000m and women's 10,000 meters, featuring American record holder Deena
Kastor. Reigning world champion Tom Pappas will begin day one of 
competition in the javelin, and Olympic gold medalist Stacy Dragila competes in 
women's pole vault. Qualifying also will be held in the men's and women's 200
meters, and men's and women's 1,500m semifinals take the track.
 
Winning the women's and men's Special Olympics 100 meter exhibition races
were Lakasha Young (16.03) and Damond Robinson (12.41), respectively.
 
The top three finishers in each event at the Olympic Trials who have met 
the Olympic "A" standard are named to the U.S. Olympic Team for Athens.
