										<li>For those who were checked for PA/USATF in previous years, you do NOT need to be checked again, but you MUST become a USATF member in order for your scan to remain current. State law requires us to drop any non-USATF member coaches from our lists to be checked.<li>If you do not renew your membership by March 1st, you will be required to undergo a new scan at your expense in order to be become to be eligible to coach again.
										<li>Note that for those needing the background check, your club will not be accepted and practice insurance will not be issued until the check is completed and you are cleared.
										<li>The process for background checks is as follows: You need to submit your club form with payment, and you and your coaches need to become <a href="/data/membership.html">USATF members</a>. Once this is done, you will be sent a application for a Live Scan. The list of locations is posted on our website. In most cases, this will be your local police department. You need to take the Live Scan form in with you to be scanned. (Note that at some locations you may need to make a reservation in advance) You will be asked to pay for the scan which will be reimbursed to you when you send in your receipt to my office.
