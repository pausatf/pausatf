							<h4>Who Are We?</h4>

							The Pacific Association is a member Association of USA Track &amp; Field (USATF), which is the national governing body for long distance running, race walking and track and field. See more information about USATF below. PA/USATF represents the geographic area of northern California and northwest Nevada. Our geographical boundaries stretch from the California-Oregon border on the north to San Luis Obispo in central California on the south. Our east boundary stretches just beyond Reno, Nevada

							<p>The Pacific Association has about 5,000 athlete members&#151;the largest of all the USATF associations in the U.S.&#151;and over 125 member athletic clubs. Our annual budget of almost $250,000 is by far the largest of all the USATF associations.</p>

							<p>We oversee and administer region-wide programs in track and field, long distance running, ultra running, and race walking. Our largest component involves youth, who compete in all three of the aforementioned sports disciplines, and we support them with specific region-wide programs. We have developmental programs for all ages which are highly regarded throughout the country. They include Grand Prix competitions for track &amp; field, cross country, road running, and ultra running. The Pacific Association sanctions and provides liability insurance to approximately 300 athletic events in our region annually.</p>

							<p>In addition, we play an important role in the production a number of national USATF championship events. In 2000, the Pacific Association is deeply involved in the Olympic Track &amp; Field Trials and is also hosting USATF the National Junior Olympic Cross Country Championships on December 9 in Reno, NV. In 2001, we will be hosting the National Olympic Junior Track and Field Championships to be held at CSUS, Sacramento on July 24-29.</p>
