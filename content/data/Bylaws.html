		<p>(c) Nominations will be accepted by mail or electronically (e.g. e-mail or fax) at the office until the day before the Board of Athletics meeting which precedes the election meeting. Nominations from the floor will be taken at the two regularly scheduled Board of Athletics' meetings which precede the election, regardless of the presence of a quorum. Candidates must be members of the Association and be at least 18 years of age, at the start of the term of office.

The Executive Director shall handle all ballots with regard for their confidentiality and present the unopened ballots for tabulation at the election meeting.<br>
			<br>
		</p>
		<p>(e) Each voting member shall cast only one (1) ballot, regardless of how many<br>
			positions that member holds within the Board of Athletics. There shall be no proxy voting. Voters must be at least 18 years of age on the day the ballots are due. Except for renewals from the previous year, individuals must be members in<br>

			i. The minimum number of available votes are determined by the currently configured Association's Board of Athletics in compliance with the provisions of these bylaws;<br>
			ii. Article 9 of these bylaws explains how 100 percent of the available votes are divided among the following five constituencies: active athletes, coaches, officials, organizational members, and other members (which may include elected officers of the Association);<br>
			iii. In determining how 100 percent of the available votes are divided per Article 9 of these bylaws, each constituency listed in ii above will be guaranteed to have at least ten percent (10%) of the votes, except that active athletes must receive a minimum of twenty (20%);<br>
			iv. Individuals who are eligible to cast a ballot on more than one constituency must choose one constituency in which to vote;<br>
			v. Constituencies with more individuals than votes allowed will determine before the election the voters or apportionment of votes; and<br>
			vi. In the active athlete constituency, youth (18-year old), open (non-international ages 19-39), international (ten-year rule regardless of age), and Masters (40-and above) athletes must each be represented if member athletes are available. In such a case, the number of votes granted to a division above shall be as equal as possible.<br>
		</p>
		<p></p>
		<p>(g) A panel of at least three (3) individuals, at least one (1) of whom must be an athlete, shall count the ballots and sign the tally. All panel members shall be of voting age. The panel shall not include any individual who is a candidate for a contested office. Ballots (mail or electronic) shall only be opened in the presence of the entire panel. If circumstances prevent the appointed panel from convening in a timely manner, a new panel meeting the above criteria may be convened to count the ballots. The results for each round will be published at the meeting. The ballots will be kept by the office for two weeks following the election meeting and then destroyed.</p>
		<p> <br>
		</p>
		<p>(h) Regardless of whether a mail ballot is used, the President, Secretary and other Officers of the Association must be elected by a majority of the ballots cast. If a run-off election is necessary, the notification requirement shall be the same.<br>
