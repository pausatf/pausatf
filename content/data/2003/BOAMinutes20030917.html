Bylaws according at our annual meeting and submit the amended bylaws to Andy

Membership Committee Report from Irene Herman:
The summer was busy for the membership committee.
 
We combined marketing with the National Office for the Oracle and National 
Meets at Stanford. Thisyear, Andy Martin was not able to come out to Stanford so 
he asked that the Pacific Association help promote
USATF. We set-up the tent from the grant for the days of the events. At the 
National Meet, we made ourselves visible by putting on a contest for who can 
jump the farthest on the high jump runway, in which, we
used for a long jump pad. Lloyd Stephenson(tentkeeper) MLDR, Tim Wason XC, 
Dave Ahn, Stanford Alumni and LDR and Steve Woo, including Irene Herman,all 
manned the station during the meet days and into the evenings.JOs at Logan High 
School was another busy event for
membership. Tony Williams, Youth membership rep.worked diligently with youths 
and birthdate verification while Irene Herman was validating the
"it's in the mail" members. Tony Williams will be spearhead suggestions and 
ideas with the youth committee on how to encourage early membership for 
2004.Lately, Pat Randall, new official certificate rep will also be part of the 
membership committee.
 
Dan Preston, Lloyd Stephenson & Ed Parrot has been very instrumental at 
assisting membership at LDR championships. 
 
The PA banner will also be flying at the Paso Robles 10K Master Championship 
where Irene Herman will be assisting Charles Des Jardin in validating 
membership for this event.
 
The Tent Keeper, is Lloyd Stephenson. If committee needs to borrow the tent 
please contact Lloyd.
