&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was discussion about the composition of the committee and who gets to vote.  Garland Murphy was elected masters rep by the masters athletes present at the meeting and Danielle Kirk and Robyn Stevens were appointed Senior Athlete Reps by Art Klein with the approval of the rest of the committee.  With ten current voting committee members aside from the Senior Athlete reps, two senior athlete reps fill the requirement, but if one or more of the three vacant positions is filled, then a third senior athlete rep will need to be appointed if available.

<LI><B>2004 Grand Prix Series</b></li><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was discussion about the 2004 grand prix series and general consensus that a race should be eliminated.
<BR><BR>
<B>MOTION:</b>
(Dick Petruzzi, second Ed Parrot) that only the 5K/10K and 20K be declared championships in 2004.  This will ease a little bit of the pressure on judges.  Passed unanimously.
<BR><BR>
<B>MOTION:</b>
(Ed Parrot, second Dick Petruzzi) that the 5K in Santa Cruz be eliminated from the 2004 series.  Passed with one opposed.
<BR><BR>
<B>MOTION:</b>
(Ed Parrot, second Nicolle Goldman) that we have the same races in 2004 except for the 5K in Santa Cruz and an hour to be determined later.  Discussion led to considering the hour sometime between March and May and the following tentative schedule being passed unanimously as part of the motion:
<BR>
March/April – 20K either in Sacramento or at Travis with help from Danielle Kirk<BR>
May – Mile in Stockton<BR>
June – 5K as part of PA/USATF Track & Field Championship<BR>
July – 3K in Reno<BR>
Sept – 15K in Oakland<BR>
Oct – 10K in Seaside<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Fund-Raising Raffle for Robyn Stevens</b></li><BR>
Discussion centered on how many tickets to have printed.  Ron and Art outlined that the tickets will be $10 and three for $25, working with the North American Race Walking Foundation to get a tax deduction for the $25 amount.  There was consensus that we would print 250 tickets with 250 more printed if demand requires.
