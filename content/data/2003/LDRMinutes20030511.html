Jamba Juice, or whoever places highest and can go. No change made to this
approach.

SCORING CHANGES 
The committee discussed and voted on various changes proposed by the

road race be 3.0. The motion was defeated by a vote of 1-9.

made.
Increasing Cost of points above 2.0 to $2,600 per 0.5 point: A motion was
made and defeated, 1-4, with 5 abstentions.
One point higher rule: A motion was made that no race can be more than 1.0
points higher than the next highest race. The motion passed 6-4.
Change point weighting for older age groups (due to smaller amounts of
prize money received by these groups): no motion was made.
 
2. CROSS COUNTRY

awarded to runners competing in all races. The motion was withdrawn.
Bonus for running more than 6 races: A motion was made to award one point

the minimum of $500. The motion was withdrawn.
 
 
 
BUDGET REQUEST
The LDR budget request was distributed to the committee. The request
netted $33,650 and is the same as for this year, except for the following:
$20,000 has been requested for the Road Grand Prix, up from $15,000;
$1,000 has been requested for performance of the year, up from $0. A
motion was made to approve the request, and was passed unanimously.
 
ANNUAL BANQUET
Mark Winitz of West Valley Joggers & Striders said he would explore
whether his club would be willing to host the banquet. Tamalpa was
suggested as a possible backup. [West Valley Joggers & Striders have since
declined to host.]
 
SCORESHEET SUBMISSIONS
A motion was made and unanimously approved to let the scorer send
reminder emails to clubs that have not submitted scoresheets by the
deadline. The scorer will not be required to send such emails. Similarly,
when the scorer does send such emails out, it cannot be guaranteed that
all full teams will be notified. Furthermore, it was decided not to
attempt to automate the scoresheet (making no submission required) at this
time.
 
PRIZE MONEY BREAKDOWN PROPOSAL
A proposal was made that the prize money breakdown starting in 2004 be
changed as follows. A vote will be taken at the Humboldt meeting.
 
For open teams, the breakdown for a 1.0 point race is currently $275 for
first, and $125 for second. It has been proposed that it be changed to
$200 for first, $125 for second, and $75 for third. 
For masters teams, the breakdown is currently $150 for first and $50 for
second. It has been proposed that it be changed to $125 for first, and $75
for second.
For seniors, teams currently get $50 for first place and the top
individual gets $75. It has been proposed that the first-place team gets
$75 and the top individual gets $50.
 
TEAM USA MONTEREY BAY
Mark Winitz gave a report on the Team Monterey Training Camp. It will
have a July 15 starting date and the coach will be Bob Sevene.
 
Meeting adjourned at 12:22.
