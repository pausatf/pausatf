We have always budgeted for a

This is a first in the past 22 years.
At current spending level we are going to run
deficits if we do not curtail spending levels.
Motion to approve financial report; seconded and passed.
The Financial Procedures should be available
by next meeting; will keep you posted.
<br /> 
<br /><b><u>4.
CHAMPIONSHIPS:</u></b> NCAA
Championships in <st1:City><st1:place>Sacramento</st1:place></st1:City>, Outdoor Championships at Stanford Junior and Seniors.
All information is online.
Official help is still needed at all meets.
Officials have committed but more are needed
to help with those long hour days.
Ticket sales for NCAA are doing extremely well; sold approximately 1,000
4-day pass tickets through initial mailings; total of 4,000 for 4 days.
The goal is to average 8,000 a day.
Promotion has been directed to previous
Olympic Trials purchasers.
A kiosk and
display will be at all major track meets coming up.
This should help to draw interest from all
areas.
This meet will be the biggest
NCAA championships of any other sport by far; expected over 1,100
athletes.
Athletes must meet minimum
qualifying standard to compete.
<st1:City><st1:place>Sacramento</st1:place></st1:City> is going to make a bid for three years; 2005,
2006 and 2007 to host the NCAA again.
All volunteers will have to go through security clearances.
The 2005 JO championship meet was not awarded
at the convention.
It is still not open
to all comers yet.
The <st1:place>Midwest</st1:place> region is the region that is supposed to
bid.
If the negotiations is not
announced by June or July it will be allowed to all comers.
Our year to bid for is 2007 for track and
field and 2006 for cross country.
We do
not make those bids until 2005 for the 2007 meet and 2004 for the 2006 meet. 
<br /> 
<br /><b><u>5.
2004 OLYMPIC TRIALS:</u></b>
Schedule for the Olympic Trials is on the
website.
32,000 tickets have been sold
already and they have not been released to the public yet.
Only 8-day packages have been sold.
The package sales will probably be sold up
until 2 weeks before the meet.

<br /> 
<br /><b><u>6. </u></b><st1:City><st1:place><b
><u>SAN LUIS OBISPO</u></b></st1:place></st1:City><b
><u>:</u></b> <st1:place><st1:PlaceName>San Luis Obispo</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType>County</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> is being cooperative in support of allowing athletes to become part of
the Pacific Association.
We have
received a letter already from one of the youth clubs in support of the
move.
In addition, several other
individuals have sent letters in support of the move.
We need additional letters especially from
officials, athletes and other non athletes.
All responses so far have been positive.
When we have the case well in hand, it will be presented.
<br /><b><u> </u></b>
<br /><b><u> </u></b>
<br /><b><u>7. BY
LAW REVISIONS:</u></b> At
the last meeting by laws were passed out that need to be revised and sent to
the national office to bring our association into compliance.
There are just a few housekeeping items to
take care of.
When all is said and done
we will be more in compliance than any other association.
Amendments are made to our by laws to make
sure we are covered by the appropriate number of athletes, coaches, officials,
youth, organizational members, etc.
Under letter “I”, first line, the minimum number of available votes “is”
not “are”.
Under J, <st1:City><st1:place>Tyler</st1:place></st1:City> wants to add to the end of the first sentence in
so far as this does apply, “if a committee does not have an election procedure
in place, the procedure outlined in this article will be used insofar as it
applies”.
A motion is made, seconded
and accepted regarding amendments to our current bylaws.
There are three “at large” appointments to
the board that need to be taken into account since it is a national
requirement.
Currently, the bylaws
stipulate the agenda and minutes should be available 30 days prior to the
scheduled meeting.
This rule should be
changed to apply to the annual meeting only which will avoid the possibility of
other meetings being classified as null and void because of the 30 day
rule.
This rule can be added to apply to
all annual committee meetings.
This will
do away with those associations who call impromptu meetings without proper
notification to all parties involved.
The rule currently stipulates a one to two week period of time to notify
all parties.

<br /> 
<br /><b><u>8. GRIEVANCES:</u></b>
We have no
new grievances.
Membership is still
being refused to Billy Ray Smith regarding reinstatement to the association.
This is currently in the appeal stage to the
National Office.
<br /> 
<br /><b><u>9. SERVICE AWARDS:</u></b>
Our Tom
Moore award was issued for the first time last year to Tom Moore.
Harmon Brown and Herb Rosenbaum are both
nominated for the Tom Moore award for this year.
That is under discussion at this time.
Two Service Awards will also be given out
this year to individuals for their service to the association.
A list of 14 nominations will be sent out
with the ballot this year.
John Mansoor is
nominated but he graciously declined the nomination.
Mark Winitz is nominated and declined the
nomination as well.
A nomination is made
to have a Pacific Association Hall of Fame and have inductees for those who
deserve this recognition on an annual basis.
Suggestion made to increase the number of awards and/or frequency until
we are caught up.
A motion is made to
make this an annual presentation instead of every two years.
Motion is seconded and passed.
It is agreed that the voting will be done via
email.
Presentation of honorees will be
made at the annual meeting in <st1:City><st1:place>Sacramento</st1:place></st1:City>.
<br />
