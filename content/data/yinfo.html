<h3>Change of venue for Subbantam Championships</h3>
West Contra Costa Unified School District has just cancelled the use of 
Pinole Valley High School for our Subbantam Championships tomorrow.  
We have however, graciously been given permission to use Granada High 
School (same facility as last weekend's meet).  We want to thank Brad 
Morisoli, Head Track and Field Coach of Granada High School, Michelle 
Doggett of Tri Valley Vault Athletics and Sue Walker of Livermore Valley 
Unified School District, for making this possible on such short notice.  
We truly know who cares about our young student athletes.   
 
We are adding an additional half hour to 45 minutes to the starting time 
to allow time for those who do not receive this information in time to 
change their plans.  Again thanks to Brad, Michelle and Sue for coming 
through for us.  
 
The address to Granada High School is 400 Wall Street in Livermore.  
From Oakland:  Take 880 south to 238.  Highway 238 turns into 580.  Stay 
on 580 to Portola exit in Livermore.  Turn right to Murrietta.  Turn right 
on Stanley then left on Wall.  School is on the left. 
From San Jose:  Take 680 north to Vallecitos / Highway 84 towards 
Livermore.  Turn right on Isabel, then right Stanley and right on Wall.

Anthony's Quick Club Manager Meet Entry
 
Read through the documentation because there is initial setup you must do 
before entering athlete(s) [takes less than one minute].  Once the setup 
is done, enter the athlete(s) information and event(s) into the program 
by clicking on the "add new member" button.  When done with that, go back 
to the main screen and click on the "enter meet" button which is on the 
same line as the athlete(s) name.  This must be done for each athlete 
entering the meet.  On the bottom of the screen you can then enter the 
athlete(s) into the events.  Check the meet entries by clicking on the 
"show meet entries" button on the main screen and verifying that all 
entries are correct.  If something is wrong  go back to "enter meet" 
button and make the necressary changes.  Come back to verify that 
everything is correct.  If it is, go back to the main screen, click 
on "create meet manager file", name it appropriately, save it to a 
location you can easily find and email it to 
Anthony Camargo at ajcam@sbcglobal.net.

I have received so many emails and inquiries regarding the use of Club Manager.  
For various reasons, people are not able to or can’t/won’t use the program.  
Below is an entry form that can be used for the PAC Championship meet 
only at Pinole High School in Pinole.  This is reserved for those who find 
it much too difficult and do not have the time or inclination to use the Club 
Manager program.  We will not however, use any mail-in entry forms at all for 
the JO Championship meet at Granada High School in Livermore.  So in actuality, 
using this now is a good warm up for the JO meet when it becomes mandatory.    

If using the entry form below, please mail your entries and payment together 
as indicated.    If you have questions do not hesitate to call me at 510 430-8223 
after 8 pm or 510 879-8642,  9am-5pm.  amjcamargo@sbcglobal.net

SUBJECT:	Which File To Email

There seems to be some confusion as to which file to E-Mail in from the 
Club Manager. The file we need is produced from the Membership list screen 
(the initial screen when you bring up the Club Manager).  There is a button 
on this screen labeled "Create Meet Manager File".  This will produce the 
required file for Hytek Meet Manager and this is the one to send in via E-Mail.

SUBJECT:	Club Manager Reminder

We introduced the Club Manager program back in January.  It has been over 
4 months now, which is ample time to familiarize yourself with the program
before the mandatory use of it at the JO Championships on June 23-25th.  
The meet directors who offered the use of the program this season for 
track meet entries have been from CA Track Club, TNT/Deer Valley, UMOJA, 
Central Valley Road Runners and the PAC Championships.  We can count on 
one hand the number of clubs that have used it and we would like to thank 
those clubs and the meet directors for offering it.

It is now crunch time.  We do not plan to get bombarded with questions 
and/or problems regarding the use of the Club Manager Program at the last 
minute.  You should have already familiarized yourself with it.  There 
will be no sympathy if you have problems at the last minute.  We therefore
encourage you to play around with program NOW if you have not done so 
already.  It is much easier to field questions now rather than later.

Contact Joanne at amjcamargo@sbcglobal.net if you need a copy of Club 
Manager.  Club Manager has an exe extension and has created a problem to 
some ISP’s.  If you have a problem opening the program or have additional 
questions, do not hesitate to contact Charlie Sheppard on its use.   
His email address is charlie.sheppard.home@worldnet.att.net.

It has just recently been brought to my attention that the dates for the 
Subbantam Championships and the Region 14 Junior Olympic Championships 
have incorrect dates posted in the latest issue of the CTRN magazine.  
The meet dates are listed with June instead of July dates as correctly 
posted on our Youth Schedule.  Per CTRN personnel, the dates will be 
corrected in the upcoming issue of the CTRN magazine.

<h3>Download program fix for Club Manager</h3>
A problem has just been found in the copy of the clubmanager program that
you recently received by e-mail. The program will fail if entering more 
than one relay team into a meet. The file in the link below will correct 
the problem.
 
Download the file in the link below into the folder that you extracted the 
clubmanager program into.  Before you download it, check to see if you have
already created meet entries that you want to save: startup clubmanager then 
click on the button labeled Show meet entries. This will display all the 
meet entries that you have created so far.
 
If there are no records showing, then no further action is required. 
If records are showing that you wish to save, then click on the button 
labeled Save meet to file. Once you have saved the entries then close 
down clubmanager and then download the file from link below.

This will replace the file named entermeet.PAU. If you saved meet entries 
then start clubmanager again and goto the show meet entries. On this screen
click on the button labeled Restore a meet from file. Restore the file 
just saved. This procedure will restore clubmanager to its status prior 
to the fix.

SUBJECT:	Facility Change for Region 14 JO Meet


I found out last week that Folsom High School has decided not to allow us 
the use their facility for our Region 14 Junior Olympic Championships July
7-9, 2006.  Individuals have been feverishly trying to find another site 
in the Northern portion of our association.  However, I put in a call to 
Granada High School personnel to see if we could possibly use their 
facility again this year just in case they could not come through for us.
And also realizing it was such short notice, to try to have something 
already in the works.  We promised to give until Monday to finalize things
with the Northern section to see if they could find somewhere to host the 
meet.  They did not.

Therefore, the Region 14 Junior Olympic Championships track meet scheduled
for Folsom High School July 7-9, has now officially been changed to 
Granada High School in Livermore; same site as the Junior Olympics 
Championships two weeks prior.  If you have any questions or concerns 
please give me a call at  510 430-8223 after 8 pm, 510  879-8642 9-5 pm, 
or email me at amjcamargo@sbcglobal.net.

SUBJECT:	Schedule Change for Long Jump
		Schedule Change for YG, YB Shot Put
		PAC Championship Meet
		June 10 - 11, 2006

During the summer championship meets, the high schoolers have normally 
contested the long jump and triple jump both on Sunday.  We received a 
few complaints regarding this and decided last year to make a change 
for our 2006 championship meet schedule.  I forgot to make that change 
when putting the schedule together this year.  I am now therefore, making 
those necessary changes.  The SBG, SBB, BG, BB, MG and MB will change 
from Saturday to Sunday.  The IG, IB, YW and YM will change from Sunday 
to Saturday.   For those athletes who contest both the long and triple 
jump they will have much fresher legs to contest their triple jump.

It has also been brought to my attention that we have three throwing 
events for the Youth age group on Saturday.  The YG and YB Shot Put 
has been moved from Saturday to Sunday.  

Please check the PA Youth Championship field event schedule below.  
Contact me if you have questions or concerns regarding any of these 
changes.  510 879-8642  (9-5), 510 430-8223  (after 8pm).

We are in the midst of pulling together the Junior Olympic Program for the 2006 track season.  
I know there are athletes out there who have artistic talent they want to display regarding 
their experience(s) with track and field during last season or before.  

We need athletes to send a short description or story (100 words or less) AND original art 
work please, of themselves competing in their favorite event.  We are limited on space so 
publication will be determined on a first-come first-serve basis and/or originality.  Scan 
the drawing and email it along with your short description or story to ajc_arts@yahoo.com.  
The deadline date for receipt of this material is June 3, 2006.

Dear Youth Committee:

I would like to thank all the clubs, parents and coaches who came out to 
help at the first track and field meet of our 2006 track and field season.  
Without your help it would not have been possible to have any semblance of 
a track meet.  Unfortunately things did not go as well as expected.

My apologies for any and everything that went wrong.  It was not my 
intention to host a bad track meet.  This was my first time as a youth 
Meet Director and I truly wanted to do things right.  Unfortunately I 
did not appreciate the degree and complexity of even a "small" youth meet.  
My lack of preparedness severely compromised the quality of the meet.  
This has been a difficult learning experience and I vow to never allow 
anything of this nature to happen again. 

The youth teams of the PAUSATF normally give good meets.  SO, for those 
first time parents and athletes, please do not let this experience dampen
your enthusiasm.   

For those athletes who did not pick up their ribbons, you may pick them up
at the East Bay Heat meet on March 25th at Berkeley High School.  I will 
be helping out at the awards station.  If you have additional questions 
or concerns, please feel free to e-mail me at sampledk@yahoo.com and I 
will be more than happy to respond.

Again, thank you all for coming and hope to see you at other PAUSATF 
youth meets.

Sincerely,

Deborah Sample

SUBJECT:	Event cancellations

I have checked on the softball field consistently since last week and the rain 
has it completely soaked with water reaching ankle deep.  With more rain expected 
again this week I have therefore decided to cancel the discus, shot put and 
regular javelin.  The mini-jav will still take place in the middle of our football 
field as usual.  

My plans are to contact those individuals or coaches whose entries I have already 
received with athletes entered in those three events.  However, you can contact 
me immediately if you choose to have them do another event.  If they are only 
entered in these events I will cancel them altogether from the track meet unless 
you instruct me otherwise.  

Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause you and look forward to seeing you this 
weekend.  RAIN or SHINE!!

<i>04/22/05</i>

<big><big><big><b>Pacific Association United States of America
Track and Field Championship Meets</b></big></big></big>

The following are lists for individual and track team working positions for the upcoming 
Pacific Association Championship track meets.  Some people have already contacted us for 
their desired positions while others have been asked to handle certain positions.  We 
want every team interested in receiving part of the travel fund money disbursement to 
contact us.   Unattached athletes cannot receive funds from the association but we appreciate 
help from their family and friends as well.  

Our plan is to be able to rotate personnel and have shifts in most positions where possible.  
When the “Un-Filled Positions” are filled, they will be moved to the “Filled Positions” category.  
Please look over the lists carefully and decide where you and/or your team wish to work.  Let 
us know via email and it will be added to the roster for that particular track meet.  If your 
name is on our list and it should not be there, let us know; it will be removed.  If your name 
was inadvertently left off and it should be on our list; let us know; it will be added.  If you 
can think of additional positions needed that are not listed, please let us know that as well.  
We want all conceivable areas covered. Remember, our track meets can be successful only if we 
work together to make them a success.

The five track meets hosted by the Youth Committee this year are:

•	Sub Bantam Championships – Sunday, June 5, 2005
        <a href="http://www.pausatf.org/data/2005/YTFvolunteerJun5.htm">Volunteer List June 5</a>

On Friday afternoon June 24 and July 8 the Hammerthrow and Steeplechase will be contested at Chabot 
College in Hayward.  The Hammerthrow has never been included as an event for our association youth 
meets but has been added as an exhibition event only starting this year.  Hammerthrow experts are 
welcome to contact us regarding the officiating of this event.  Your expertise is greatly needed and 
appreciated.  Please contact Mike Hammerquist if you can help us with the Hammerthrow.  (510) 848-8583)

FROM:	Joanne Slaton-Camargo
		Youth Chair

Our 2005 track season is well underway now.  We are working hard to not have a repeat of last season 
with the numerous amounts of cancellations. There have been two but the slots were immediately filled 
with another track meet on both occasions, so to date, no gaps in the schedule. 

I am again addressing the responsibility we the Youth Committee have, of hosting our five championship 
meets this year.  Again, the proceeds from these meets will be disbursed amongst the teams who work 
towards the success of those meets.  We will soon put a volunteer list online for your benefit.  
Please take a good look at it and let us know via email what area(s) you choose to have your team work.  
The email addresses related to the specific meets will be listed online along with that particular track 
meet.  So, all five track meets will be taken into account for this year’s disbursement of funds instead 
of two meets like last year.  If you have already contacted us and I have inadvertently left your team 
name off our list, please let me know immediately.  amjcamargo@sbcglobal.net   If you haven’t signed up 
yet, please do so as soon as possible.

This is an election year.  If you are interested in running for any of our youth committee positions, please 
send your nomination to John Mansoor at 120 Ponderosa Court, Folsom, CA 95630 or email him at pausatf@aol.com.  
Your nomination must be received by May 1, 2005.   The nominator and nominee must be a registered member of 
USATF and if a member of a track club, that team must be registered with PAUSATF as well.  Ballots will be 
mailed out by May 15, 2005 and must be returned to PAUSATF Executive Headquarters by May 31, 2005.   Elected 
officers will take office on August 1, 2005.    The positions up for election are:  Chair, Vice Chair, 
Secretary, Treasurer, Track Chair, Field Chair, Racewalk Chair, Multi Events Chair, High School Chair, 
Officials Chair, Communications Chair, Cross Country Chair, Membership Chair and Records Chair.

Certain elite athletes do not have to participate in the preliminary Junior Olympic meets and can be 
advanced directly to the Junior Olympic Nationals based on special circumstances.  If you have an athlete 
who may possibly meet the qualifications, please notify Susan Johnson, our Regional Coordinator.  
ssnjohnson@comcast.net She must submit the request in writing before our Region 14 meet in July.  
The National Office will make their determination on a case-by-case basis.

Reminder:  If an athlete in 4th, 5th or 6th place make the qualifying standards to advance to the Junior 
Olympic Nationals AND 1st, 2nd or 3rd places are not going, they can go in their place to represent our 
region.  Those standards will be available soon and at our Region 14 meet in July.

Reminder:  You must register your track team before May 1st to avoid the assessment of an additional 
$100 late fee in addition to your regular $75 registration fee which will result in a registration 
fee total = $175.  You have exactly one month to get it paid!!

SUBJECT:	Team Registration

I am concerned that all the youth clubs who plan to participate this season pay their registration 
fee as soon as possible.  The National office enacted a new ruling at last year’s convention that 
will assess late fees for all clubs not registered by May 1, 2005.  Attached is a listing from our 
Pacific Headquarters of the teams currently registered for 2005.  If your team name is not listed 
here please contact John Mansoor at (916) 983-4715 or pausatf@aol.com  immediately.  This is just 
a friendly reminder.  $100 + $75 = $175
