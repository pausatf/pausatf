<h2>Race Walking Grand Prix Rules</h2>

<p align="center"><b>Pacific Association &#150; USATF Grand Prix Race Walking Rules</b></p>
							<p><i>For more information on the annual PA/USATF Race Walking Grand Prix, please contact one the the following:<br>
								</i><st1:PersonName>
Art Klein </st1:PersonName>
, Race Walking Chair, at <a href="mailto:%20kleinwalk@comcast.net">kleinwalk@comcast.net</a><br>
								
Jon Price, Grand Prix Scorer, at <a href="mailto:%20jprice@unr.edu">jprice@unr.edu</a><br>
								<br>
								<b>I. Schedule:</b><br>
								<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;The 2012 USATF Pacific Race Walking Grand Prix shall consist of 5 events. See the <a href = "http://www.pausatf.org/data/2012/rwschedule2012.html">schedule page </a> for the dates, times, entry forms, and other relevant information. </p>

							
								<b><br>
									II. Eligibility:<br>
								</b></p>
							<p>    &nbsp;&nbsp;All athletes must be USATF Pacific members for the current
 year BEFORE they can score points in any race, either as individuals or
 for teams. Please don't wait until race day to obtain your membership -
 we cannot guarantee that memberships will be available at all the 
races. The best way to get a membership is to go to the <a href = "http://www.usatf.org/Products---Services/Individual-Memberships.aspx"> USATF web site </a>.
 Any disputes about 
membership status shall be referred to the USATF Pacific Membership 
Committee for a ruling.  Athletes who are members of a USATF association other than the Pacific Association but choose to compete in Pacific Association races can receive points in the Pacific Association grand prix competition only if they are not competing in another association's grand prix that same year.<br>
								<br>
							</p>
							<p><b>III. Standings:<br>
								</b></p>
							<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;This year’s USATF Pacific Race Walking Grand Prix shall 
consist of five (5) events. Points shall be awarded to teams and individuals at 
each of the grand prix races. Grand Prix standings in each division 
shall be calculated by adding up the points obtained at the best four 
(4) of the five (5) races, for teams and individuals. Please note that some of these dates are 
tentative - check back regularly for updates on the Race Walking 
schedule page. <br>
								<br>
							</p>
							<p><b>IV. Team Points Scoring:<br>
								</b></p>
							<p>    A. All Clubs must be registered USATF Pacific Association 
clubs for the current year BEFORE they can score points as a team. 
Athletes who are members of clubs that have not registered as a USATF 
club for the year will be considered unattached until their club 
registers (or they switch clubs).<br>
							</p>
							<p>    B. All USATF rules for team scoring and eligibility shall apply unless specifically excepted in these Rules.<br>
							</p>
							<p>    C. There is only one team division - an age graded division open to athletes of any age or gender.<br>
							</p>
							<p>    D. Teams shall be scored based on the average age graded 
percentage of the top three (3) athletes for each club. A club may have 
as many athletes as it likes entered in each race, but only the top 
three age graded percentages shall count for team scoring.<br>
							</p>
							<p>    E. In order to score for a club, the athlete MUST be 
registered for that club before the race. Either the athlete must be 
affiliated with the club in the USATF membership database before the 
race, or the athlete must have been approved to walk for the club by the
 USATF Pacific Membership Committee.<br>
							</p>
							<p>    F. Teams do not need to declare for a race beforehand or 
submit information after the race. All Pacific Association USATF Member 
clubs and individuals (who are current for this year) shall be scored 
according to their official club affiliation.<br>
							</p>
							<p>    G. Only one team from each club may score - no "B" teams will score.<br>
							</p>
							<p>    H. Points are scored at each race as follows. All USATF 
Pacific Teams with at least 3 USATF Pacific member finishers shall 
receive at least one point:<br>
