								INDIANAPOLIS - The Pacific Asociation's Stephanie Brown Trafton&nbsp;plus Jenn Stuczynski will headline Team USA's women's field eventers at the 12th IAAF World Championships in Athletics, August 15-23 in Berlin, Germany.<br>
								&nbsp;<br>
								Brown Trafton favored in discus<br>
								&nbsp;<br>
								Stephanie Brown Trafton of Galt (Cal Poly SLO grad), the gold medalist at the 2008 Olympic Games, leads the field in the women's discus throw and is the hands-down favorite to become the first American woman to take home the World discus title. <br>
								&nbsp;<br>
								She ended the 2008 season ranked #1 in the world and won her first U.S. national title in that event with a best throw of 64.25 meters/210 feet 9 inches. Brown Trafton set the world leader earlier this season, throwing a personal best 66.21m/217-2 in winning the USATF Pacific Association Championship, and owns four of the worlds top ten throws.<br>
								&nbsp;<br>
								Brown Trafton will be joined on the Team USA roster for Berlin by Nationals runner-up and four-time Olympian Aretha Thurmond (62.51m/205-1), and two-time World Outdoor Championships team member Becky Breisch, who finished third with a toss of 62.08m/203-8.<br>
								&nbsp;<br>
								Stuczynski reaching for gold<br>
								&nbsp;<br>
								The dominant force in American women's pole vault, three-time USA Outdoor champion and 2008 Visa Outdoor champion Jenn Stuczynski is looking to follow up on her silver medal at the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing. Stuczynski's main competition comes in the form of Russia's Yelena Isinbayeva, a two-time Olympic gold medalist and five-time World champion (two outdoor, three indoor), who could be vulnerable this year after suffering a rare defeat at the London Grand Prix on July 24. <br>
								Winner of the first-ever world crown in the women's pole vault, Stacy Dragila from Auburn (Placer High and Yuba College)&nbsp;will make what is expected to be he r last appearance on the world stage. Dragila has had a long and prosperous career, winning the 2000 Olympic gold medal and two World Outdoor titles ('99, '01). Also competing for the United States will be 2006 NCAA Indoor champion Chelsea Johnson of Atascadero.. <br>
								&nbsp;<br>
								Carter ready after personal best in Stockholm<br>
								&nbsp;<br>
								Two-time USA Outdoor champion Michelle Carter,&nbsp;who was born in San Jose,&nbsp;leads the American contingent in the women's shot put. The 2004 World Junior champion, Carter traveled to Stockholm after winning her second U.S. title, where she threw a personal best 19.13m/62-9.25. It is the farthest throw by an American since 2001. Joining Carter will be four-time USA Indoor champion Jillian Camarena out of Woodland High and Stanford and three-time USA Outdoor champion Kristin Heaston from Walnut Creek (Ygnacio Valley High, Diablo Valley College, and Cal).&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
								&nbsp;<br>
								Long Jump<br>
								&nbsp;<br>
								Brittney Reese, after finishing fifth at the 2008 Olympics, has had a stellar 2009 campaign that saw her win her second-consecutive National title in the women's long jump and set a personal best 7.06m/23-2 with her win in Belem, Brazil. In her pursuit of the medal stand in Berlin, Funmi Jimoh has recently taken a few lessons from Erich Drechsler, ex father-in-law and ex-coach of former Olympic champion Heike Drechsler. Jimoh currently has the third-farthest jump in the world with her personal best 6.96m/22-9.75 from her runner-up finish in Doha. 2009 USA Outdoor runner-up B rianna Glenn should also be in the mix. <br>
								&nbsp;<br>
								Howard rounding back into '05 form<br>
								&nbsp;<br>
								2005 World Outdoor silver medalist Chaunte Howard will lead the American contingent of female high jumpers. With a season best 1.98m/6-6 so far this year, Howard seems back to the form she had in 2005 before taking off in 2007 to become a mother. Four-time Olympian Amy Acuff is back for her eighth, and according to her, final World Championships team. 2008 Olympian Sharon Day (Cal Poly)&nbsp;qualified for her first World Outdoor Championships with her third-place finish at the 2009 USA Outdoor Championships. <br>
								&nbsp;<br>
								Other athletes to watch<br>
								&nbsp;<br>
								2009 USA Outdoor women's triple jump champion Shakeema Welsch will be joined by three-time USA Outdoor champion Shani Marks and 2008 Olympian Erica McLain (Stanford&nbsp;grad and&nbsp;Menlo Park resident). Three-time USA Outdoor champion Jessica Cosby leads the way for the red,&nbsp; white and blue in the women's hammer throw field that includes three-time USA Indoor champion and 2008 Olympian Amber Campbell and two-time USA Outdoor champion Erin Gilreath. Also watch for two-time USA Outdoor champion Kara Patterson and two-time NCAA champion Rachel Yurkovich in the women's javelin. <br>
								&nbsp;<br>
								This will be the first time Team USA has returned to Berlin for a major international championship competition since the 1936 Olympic Games, where National Track &amp; Field Hall of Famer Jesse Owens won gold medals in the 100m, 200m, 4x100m relay and long20jump.<br>
