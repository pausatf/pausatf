						<li>
							<p><b>Timeline for Nominations and Awards</b></p>
							<p>February/March:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Invite all members of the Board of Athletics and the Chairs of &nbsp;each committee to nominate candidates under the criteria above.
								
								<li>A memo is &nbsp;then prepared and given to Folsom for distribution.
								
								<li>At the first meeting after this memo goes out, solicit nominees in open session.
							
							</ul>
							<p>March/April:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Finalize the list of nominees, including people identified by the committee, nominated as a result of the memo, and nominated in the open meeting.
								
							
								<li>The list of previous nominees who have not won the award should be included as well.&nbsp;
								
							
								<li>Prepare a memo giving each person&rsquo;s qualifications, and send this to the Folsom office, for distribution.
								
							
								<li>It&rsquo;s useful to include a due-date for votes to be returned.&nbsp; Most come in within a few days, of course.
								
							
								<li>Folsom will then send this list out to the full Board of Athletics, each member is&nbsp;invited to vote for two candidates, and the awards chair tabulates the results.
								
							
								<li>In years when new officers are elected, this election is part of the same process.
								
							
								<li>(note: in 2004 &ldquo;election,&rdquo; some ballots came directly to the Awards Chair, some were forwarded to Awards Chair from Folsom, and Awards Chair tabulated results.&nbsp; It is very useful to have/make a list of eligible voters and check them off as they vote.)
								
							
								<li>When the results are final, have plaques/awards made with text such as the following:

										<li><b>Tom Moore Award</b>
