That spirit will beevident on Sunday, June 7, 1998 when some of the most talented longdistance runners in the country cruise into town on modern day prairieschooners (the jets of Reno Air). This year, they will  compete for anenriched prize purse of $10,600 (plus race record bonuses) at the RenoAir 15K Showdown.<a href="#prize">Reno Air $10,600 Prize purse</a>"We added showdown to our name in anticipation of a real showdown amongtop runners, and to emphasize the western flavor of our events,” explainsrace director, Bill Meister. "The new prize money structure andwestern-style perks will definitely make our race more appealing thanever. We're aiming for the Big Sky this year.”To tie together a chuck wagon full of race weekend festivities, the raceorganizers have promised a bonanza of activities that offer something forthe entire family. In addition to the traditional longer race—which onceagain serves as the 15K Championship for USA Track and Field's PacificAssociation (PA/USATF)—the companion Boomtown 5K, 15K relay, and KirbyKangaroo kids runs, will provide rewards for everyone.Last year, the new race venue, centered around Boomtown Hotel and Casinoin historic Verdi, Nevada (7 miles west of Reno), proved popular withevent participants. It should again. The race courses undulate through abeautiful valley through which the Truckee Rivers meanders. And theydrift over the famous Emigrant Trail used by pioneers and gold seekersfor several decades beginning in 1845 to traverse the Sierra NevadaMountains between Verdi and California's Mother Lode country.Participants in the 15K mosey by the remains of the old Verdi Inn, animportant and sometimes bawdy oasis that sprouted from an 1860s-erastagecoach stop. Less than a decade later the mighty Central PacificRailroad line rolled through. In fact, the race route crosses the exacttracks where five bandits in 1870 boarded the Overland Express and stagedthe first Great Train Robbery of the wild west. The robbers heisted$41,600 in gold coin, before being tracked and arrested—with almost allthe loot intact. Nevada Historical Marker #128 near the race courseidentifies the spot of the robbery.It was at this very train crossing last year where a locomotive tried torob U.S. Olympian Matt Giusto of gold in the 15K men's race. Whilerace-leader Giusto narrowly beat the unexpected freight train through thejunction, eventual second-placer (and 1995 winner) Eddy Hellebuyck wasforced to take a breather while deferring to passing boxcars. Both menare expected to return this year, along with defending women's champion,Josie Edwards. However, this year they will face a showdown with some ofthe feistiest, and fastest, athletes west of the Mississippi—all intenton capturing a share of the $10,600 wealth (which the race hopes to raiseto $41,600 in future years, matching the Overland Express heist).        Top Pacific Association athletes such as local top performers AlanDehlinger, Miguel Tibaduiza, and Terry Adams-Schmidt will return to panfor nuggets of the championship prize purse, and valuable circuit points.(The 15K race is a longtime stop on PA/USATF's annual road running GrandPrix.)Olympians aren’t the only ones that will participate during Reno Air’srace weekend.
