2. MINUTES: Motion to approve minutes seconded and passed

3. TREASURERS' REPORT: As of 8-31-02 we are $32,000 in the positive for 2002. 
Expectations are to have a deficit which will be covered from our reserves. There are 
several factors that bring our income down such as sanctions and interest rates. We 
will be in better shape this year than expected at the end of the year because of extra
income from meets but we will still have a $10,000 deficit instead of the projected 
$30,000. We are however, in sound financial condition but the association as a whole, 
must still be careful with our spending in all areas. Our reserve is approximately $140,000 
plus or minus. The budget is officially closed around March of each year for the previous 
year. There is a question whether we can go back to net reporting instead of cash flow 
accounting. Even if we go back, the cash flow accounting will have to be maintained. 
Motion to approve Treasurers' report seconded and passed

4. BUDGET: The budget report consists of four columns with first being 2001 final outcome, 
the second is what we wanted to have happen in 2002, third column is what we really believe 
is going to happen in 2002 and based on that with discussions and submissions from the BOA
committees, the last column is the proposed 2003. The association should have a set of 
Financial Procedures available in 2003. Motion made to postpone approval of budget because 
of severe impact on LDR committee. Amendment to motion made that $1000 LDR did not 
use in cross country travel fund, carryover to next years budget for LDR. In actuality $500 
was put back for 2003 LDR budget. Only $500 was lost not $1000. After much discussion, 
motion withdrawn. Recommendation is made to approve existing budget and take a look at it 
again in 2003 as time goes on. Motion made to approve the budget report as submitted, 
seconded and passed. Motion made that the first $5000 from LDR type sources goes toward 
increasing the LDR budget up to $20,000 for 2003. Seconded and passed

5. GRIEVANCES: LDR Houlihan grievance, National panel ruled in favor of the association 
ruling against the athlete. Regarding the two youth grievances; they have been appealed to the 
National office and we are waiting to hear from them on those issues. Another LDR internal 
operative procedure regarding scoring teams within championship events. This has not been 
presented as a grievance, even though it is in violation of regulation 7a1d. Suggestion is to 
take it up with the Law and Legislation Committee

6. MISCELLANEOUS:
… Our association has seventeen delegates approved to vote at this years convention. The 
list is finalized with alternates included
… Jesse Owens Banquet is individual tickets unless you buy tickets all together to sit at the 
same table
… At the convention there will be no suite this year as in the past, but we will have a caucus 
Thursday morning in one of the meeting rooms
… 2002 National Cross Country Championships - course is laid out, expecting a big turnout 
from the PA; can sign up on the web now with credit card
… 2002 PA XC Championships is also the Western Regional Championships
… 2003 JR/SR Championships will be held at Stanford again.
… American Community College Elite Invitational will be held at Chabot College - March 22nd
… Golden West will be packaged with NCAA Championships and will be moved to Sunday 
at the Sac State venue. Sacramento Sports Commission will be taking over the Golden West 
from now on 
… Tickets will go on sale for the 2004 Olympic Trials in January; there has already been 
pre-season sales amongst Sacramento Sports Commission members. If you want to 
volunteer to help at the trials contact Kleeman for application
… Sacramento Sports Commission has entered into a relationship with the Gold Coast 
Corporation of Australia to alternate hosting the Pan Pacific Masters Games; odd years in 
Sacramento and even years in Brisbane, Australia. The track events will take place at either 
Hughes Stadium or American River College the first weekend in August
… Youth JO Championship meet will be hosted again at James Logan High School; our 
Region 14 meet is in Fresno; the PAC Championship meet location is to be determined
… Suggestion made that we officially try to take over San Luis Obispo County. We tried to 
do it in a nice way last year; this year we should be more aggressive. We now have all 
disciplines from youth, masters, officials, track&field, road running, everything. Hopefully will 
get an agreement between associations. Motion made to pursue a legal method of obtaining 
San Luis Obispo County, seconded and passed.

7. REPORTS:

… Excellent turnout for the 50K National Trails Championship August 24th at the Marin

… LDR - All road traveling happening this fall. Steve sent to 5K National Champions Providence, 
sending a male to Senior Bowl Championships in November, Melony to 10K National 
Championship, sending two people to the Twin Cities National Championships.
… Monterey training site has all the nuts and bolts in place; not much change. Still looking for 
a coach to run program for the first year; have received great resumes from top notch coaches 
from all over the country. Still need funding to meet that $150,000 budget needed to run 
program for the first year; have been able to raise about $20,000 thus far.

Motion to adjourn. Seconded. Our next meeting will be November 13, 2002 in Walnut Creek
