2. MINUTES:  Meeting called to order at 7:58 p.m.   
Motion to approve minutes of 1-16-02.   Seconded and passed.

3. TREASURERS’ REPORT:  Cash Flow report reflects a two month period.  We
are doing fine right now because more is coming in than is going out.  However, the
 projected shortfall for 2002 is going to be worse based on our final figures of 2001.
  Sanctions are down, interest is down, money is not from our normal sources; this will
 hit us hard in 2002.  Last year travel expenses were less, the officials brought in more
 and spent less.  These are examples of areas that helped us out in 2001; this is not
 expected in 2002.  Our final expenses ended up on the plus side by approximately
 $4,000 instead of the projected budget of -$40,000.  Every single sport committee
 must look at their expenditures and make frugal decisions as to whether or not the
 expenses they are making is justified.  We must do whatever we can to help make it
 through this year. We will still lose in the same areas as last year.  One area we should 
save again will be in travel expenses because National meets are local.  We need
 several little pieces put together this year to help make up the $20,000-$30,000
 needed to offset the deficit for us.  With any amount of luck and everyone operating
 together, things will work out just fine.  One recommendation stemming from our
 outside financial audit was to establish an accounting policies and procedures
 guidelines document for our association.   The BOD suggested establishing a
 subcommittee to work on such a manual.   Podkaminer will chair this subcommittee
 with help from Tyler Abbott, George Kleeman and Bob Bowman.  We have a target
 date of our September meeting to present this package to the committee.  The
 projected start time to work on this is not before June.  Motion to accept treasurers’
 report seconded and passed.
 

4. CHAMPIONSHIP MEETS: The officials have responded 100%.  Because of the
 combination of juniors and seniors, one day of the Nationals at Stanford should take
 12-14 hours.  The other days of the meet should be OK. The schedule is in transition
. To date there is still no contract.  The first LOC meeting for the Cross Country
 championships is taking place this Saturday in Martinez.  The only real concern is the
 facility.  They are beginning to look at plans to pave much of the course for parking
 and roads which means this may be the last time we can use Sierra College.  We have 
been using it for the past 20 years and it will be sad to see it go.  There is a tentative
 schedule for the 2003 NCAA meet being held at Sac State.  There is also some
 consideration for holding the 2006 World Cup in Sacramento.  It is not certain that
 the bid will go forward this July because of the requirements and financia
l considerations imposed by IAAF.
 

5. GRIEVANCES: There were three grievances and all hearings have been
 conducted.  The LDR grievance committee met on February 23rd in Sacramento.
  With all parties involved, the recommendation was that Bob Rowden be suspended
 from all activities in the Pacific Association for a two-year period.  He can appeal to
 the National office. Event directors will be notified of suspension.  A motion is made
 to accept the report with recommendation of suspension.  Suggestion made to impose
 further suspension if found not honoring their suspension.  Seconded and passed.  A
 letter will be drafted and sent to Rowden notifying him of the suspension and his right
 to appeal to the National office within 30 days.  The two youth grievances were heard
 separately on February 21, 2002 for Joshua Tezeno and March 26, 2002 for Cliff
 Scott.  In both cases they were found guilty and recommended suspension for 30
 days (maximum for first offense) in each case.  Both Joshua and Cliff will be notified in 
writing of their suspension with the right to appeal to the National office in 30 days of
 the decision.  A motion is made to accept the 30-day suspension penalty on the two
 youth cases.   Seconded and passed.


7. MISCELLANEOUS:    The Pacific Association has lost money in sanctions
 because certain races opted to get a cheaper insurance or because USATF could not
 satisfy their requirements.  We have notified the National Office that the California
 market is unique compared to the rest of the country.  There are requirements here
 that do not apply to the other 49 states.  Because of that Indianapolis has a tendency
 to create a policy that satisfied the other states and left us out on our own.  The
 Golden Gate Bridge is an example with the Houlihan’s race so they got their own
 insurance as did a couple of other events.  Another area is events that use non-owned
 and hired automobiles to be a part of their event.  After several lawsuits in events they
 are beginning to think about covering this area.
    

It takes about 3 months to get your membership cards from Indianapolis, but the
 information is input into our system immediately upon receipt so you can get all your
 information from our website.


8. REPORTS:
·	Bruce Colman gives suggestions on awards to be presented to deserving
 individuals.  The first award is the Lifetime Achievement award. The second award
 goes to two individuals every two years.   The Lifetime Achievement award will be
 appropriately named the Tom Moore Award with the first award going to Tom
 Moore who has contributed considerably to track and field but is currently extremely ill. The Lifetime Achievement award is not an annual award but is at the discretion of
 the BOD whenever they felt it is deserved.  Nominations and suggestions can come
 from anyone but the final decision is at the discretion of the BOD.  The second award
 is an association service award to be presented to two individuals every two years
 through a nomination and voting process.   A motion is made to accept both
 proposals.  Seconded and passed.  The first lifetime achievement award will be
 presented to Tom Moore on April 13, 2002.
  

·	Membership - has 2,606 members consisting of 664 youth, 203 officials,
 238 coaches, 1,389 LDR, 1,624 track and field, 205 racewalk.  Keep encouraging
 online registration.  Between now and June there should be approximately 2,000
 youth and 400-600 adult registrations.
  

·	Disabled athletes - for the first time outside the Para Olympic Games, May 
1-4, there will be an International Challenge Games inviting all disabilities to come
 together including international athletes.  Charlie Sheppard was selected to be the
 head starter.
  

·	Youth - during the convention last year Harold Connolly asked if we
 would contest the hammer throw during our JO regional meet this year for
 intermediate and open athletes.  They would provide everything necessary for a safe
 hammer throw event.  Chabot is a possible site; they are already being used for the
 steeplechase Friday evening before the beginning of the JO meet.  Motion made in
 favor of hammer throw if all requirements for a safe facility are met.  Seconded and
 passed.


·	LDR - The banquet is scheduled for April 7th.  I could not hear anything
 else being said
  

·	Masters -  At the National Indoor meet a 20 or 30 year old 800 meter record was broken by Nicole Teeter.  Kelli White won the 200 meter; Christy
 Gaines won the 60 meter.  Regina Jacobs won the mile.  We had between 30-40
 athletes in this event.


Motion to adjourn. Seconded.  Meeting adjourned at 9:29 p.m.  Our next meeting will
 be Tuesday, May 14, 2002 - Sheraton Grand Hotel - 12th and J Streets in
 Sacramento
