<b><u>2. MINUTES:</u></b>  Correction to minutes:  Dan Davidson, Gail Wetzork, 
Dick Iwamiya and Bob Rauch were present at the November 14, 2001 meeting in 
Walnut Creek.  They were inadvertently left off the attendance roster.  Item 7 line 1 
refers to XC Championships.  Item 8 – youth grievance is not yet in appeal process.  
Motion to approve minutes of 11-14-01 with amendments.  Seconded and passed.

<u><b>3. TREASURERS’ REPORT:</u></b>  An expense report is now necessary 
if you want reimbursement for any expenses; check with office headquarters to obtain 
form.  Motion to accept Treasurers report of November 14, 2001; seconded and passed.

<u><b>4. LAW AND LEGISLATION CHANGES:</u></b> The delegate number 
increases for each association by two.  Regarding grievances, the time period to appeal 
the decision of a hearing panel is amended from fifteen to thirty days upon receipt of a 
written grievance.  Voting within associations can now be conducted through mail or 
electronic ballot.     

<u><b>5. CHAMPIONSHIP MEETS:</u></b>  The Outdoor Junior and Senior 
Championship is being held June 21-23. Racewalk 30K Championship to be held in 
Sacramento.  Ultra Trail 50K to be held in Marin County August 24th.  The Fall 
Cross Country Championships will be Sierra College December 14th.    Masters 
Track and Field Committee has asked Sacramento to bid for the 2005 Outdoor 
Track and Field Championships as a prelude to bidding for the World Masters 
Championships in 2007 (formerly WAVA).  

<u><b>6. GRIEVANCES:</u></b>  The Houlihan’s race grievance has been turned 
over to a panel which was appointed during the last BOA meeting.  It has to be taken 
of within the next month since the person who filed the grievance is leaving the country 
for six months.  The youth grievances are at the hearing stage; currently set for February 
23rd.  The hearing will be conducted and a decision will be made at that time.     

<u><b>7. REPORTS:</u></b> 

<i>Equipment</i> – Requested and received permission to revise the budget to purchase 
six palm pilots for use at meets and clinics.    

<i>Membership</i> – 1,330 plus members currently; 32% have joined online.  This 
does not  include the multiple year memberships.  If you have not yet received your 
membership cards contact the National headquarters.
<i>Mens LDR</i> – Reebok Aggies and Impalas were the Mens and Womens 
National Masters XC Champions.  Sending six athletes to Winter Nationals in 
Vancouver next month.  
Sending a male to Senior Bowl 10K Nationals in November and woman to Top 
10K Nationals in October.  A motion is made to send a male and female to these 
non marathon events; merely a substitution since there are no marathon events this 
year.    The money has already been budgeted for the LDR Committee.  Seconded 
and passed.  Another motion is made to award a stipend up to $500 depending 
on where the event is taking place.  Currently it is set at $250.   No double dipping 
will be allowed.  Seconded and passed.

<i>Officials</i> – Thirty-one people from our association have been selected to 
work the Nationals at Stanford.  Clinics are being conducted every weekend for 
official certification.  

<i>Coaches Education</i> – Association Level 1 at Modesto upcoming weekend.  
Level II is in Boise, Idaho between July 6-16.  

<i>Racewalk</i> – Robyn Stevens wins “Henry Laskau Outstanding Junior Race 
Walker” award for 2001.  30K National Championship is awarded to Pacific 
Association by USATF RW site selection committee.  The race is scheduled for 
May 5, 2002.

<i>Masters</i> – After 30 years Los Gatos Athletic Association will not host the 
Los Gatos Classic T & F meet.  Participation has dropped from 400 to less that 
100 in five years.  It hopefully will be incorporated into the Open Grand Prix in the 
future.  Nor Cal Seniors Track Club will host the Mark Grubi Classic at U.C. 
Berkeley.

<i>Communications</i> – When there is questionable data on the website the 
most easily updated and accessible to get information out is on the website.  We 
now have three people working on it.  There are two new buttons, the Official and 
the Coaches button.  LDR has online scoring.  Club reps can put their team members 
names in and it is automatically updated daily.  The Applications button is going to be 
more organized.  From the National office of USATF we will have a calendar online
with a searchable database.

<i>Annual Convention</i> – The delegation from the Pacific Association to the 
convention was one of, if not the largest.  We not only had fourteen delegates, but 
there were ten other members of our Association at the convention as representatives 
to Sport Committees.  This allowed for superb representation.  Individual reports 
from some members of the delegation were received and are part of the overall 
submission of the delegation report made to the Board of Athletics.  The full report,
including those from individuals, is available from either the Association office or the 
Delegation Chair.  It is recommended that reporting to the constituency  be part of 
the requirements of delegation membership.
