<b>2. MINUTES:</b> Our meeting was called to order at 7:45 p.m. 
The amendments are: date change from November 13th to November 20th; 
"unestablished athletes" should be changed to "outside or non PA athletes"; 
under #4, change "increasing the LDR budget" to "increasing the LDR Grand Prix." 
Motion is made to approve minutes with amendments; seconded and passed.

<b>3. TREASURERS REPORT:</b> Motion to approve cash flow report; seconded and passed. 
Regarding the small committee working on the financial policies and procedures; 
the first draft of the first rework is out. Revision information is being collected 
from the committees throughout November and part of December. It will need to be 
approved hopefully at our January meeting and amended immediately thereafter.

<b>4. CONVENTION:</b> We were told that we only have sixteen delegates but that will be 
challenged since we have over 5,000 members; we will have seventeen. This year, 
the representatives of the committees are also the delegates. We do have a meeting 
scheduled for 7:30 a.m. Thursday morning at the convention. First round of voting 
is Friday 
morning. Runoffs are Saturday. Every representative/delegate should 
submit a report to Podkaminer as soon as possible after return from the convention. 
For the first time every there is an attempt to reorganize the Rules Book so that 
it follows in the exact order of 
the IAAF rules book. The wording is not exactly 
the same but there is an attempt to do so.

<b>5. CHAMPIONSHIPS:</b> Cross Country Championship is still looking for volunteers for 
anyone available. 5K citizens fun run in the morning.
Information is on the website for anyone interested. NCAA meet in Sacramento is 
waiting for approval of schedule. Also waiting for approval for the official's entry 
blank. Tickets will go on sale January 1st at the same time as the Olympic Trial tickets; 
both hosted in Sacramento. The Outdoor Championships in Stanford will only be a four day 
meet instead of the original five days as scheduled.

<b>6. 2004 OLYMPIC TRIALS:</b> The tickets go on sale January 1st but the 
first two months to 
purchase tickets are reserved for Sacramento 
Regional Sports Unification Foundation 
members only. There are 
currently 1,000 members who can purchase up to four tickets 
each and 
it is suspected that they will. Which means the best seats will probably be 
sold out before the general public is allowed to buy 
tickets. The Junior Nationals 
meet may also be hosted as part of the 
Olympic Trials. The additional seating added 
in the North section will most likely be needed for those additional athletes and their
coaches. 

<b>7. 2003 PAN PACIFIC MASTERS GAMES:</b> The Sacramento Sports Commission 
has entered into an 
agreement with the Gold Coast Corporation. Odd numbers years will be hosted in Sacramento 
with the even number years in Brisbane, Australia. There are up to twenty sports right now. 
It is positioned right before the national meet in Eugene so the masters will have an 
opportunity to tune up before that meet. It will also serve as the Pacific Association 
Masters meet since we did not have one for the first time. There will be a road race 
associated with this event, taking place Saturday evening in the Olympic style village 
as the start and finish of the race. The age is 30 years and up. It's a two day competition 
probably taking place at American River College instead of Sac State due to renovation to 
ready Sac State for the Olympic Trials. The date scheduled is August 2nd and 3rd. 

<b>8. 2003 YOUTH CHAMPIONSHIPS:</b> Scheduled dates of June 14-15 for the PAC Championship meet 
and June 27-29 for the JO Championship meet. The Region 14 meet is in Fresno on July 12-13. 
The youth committee, does realize there is a conflict with the date of June 14-15, therefore 
they expect minimal official help for that meet. However, 
if any official will kindly 
volunteer their services for the PAC Championship meet (June 14-15) please contact Joanne 
Slaton-Camargo at jcamargo@ousd.k12.ca.us or leave a telephone message at 510 430-8223 (home) 
or 510 879-8189 (work).

<b>9. GRIEVANCES:</b> The national office has not moved quickly enough regarding the appeals filed 
by two youth committee coaches of the PA so nothing has been resolved to date. Therefore 
the BOA has decided to enforce the 30 day suspension according to the youth operating 
procedures. A motion is made and seconded to enact the 30 day 
suspension regardless of what 
is going on with the appeal process on the national level. The motion carries.

<b>MISCELLANEOUS:</b>
<i>Membership</i> - 5,062 members registered as of November 20, 2002.
<i>Officials</i> - 48 officials have been selected to work at Stanford
<i>LDR</i> - All three grand prix are winding down. Their most exciting race was held in Paso 
Robles. There were seven runners under thirty minutes. Mitch Massey is meet director who put 
in bid to host the Masters 10K National Championships in Paso Robles. 
We are working to bring San Luis Obispo County officially into the Pacific Association.
An LDR male athlete was sent to the Twin City Nationals. A woman was supposed 
to go but could not make it. Tyler makes a motion to carry over those funds to next year. 
John suggests disbursing it amongst the women trying to qualify this year. Seconded. Discussion. 
Motion is withdrawn.
<i>This will now be a youth standing rule</i> - the number of qualifiers in track & field and the 
number of qualifiers in cross country will be divided into the travel fund proceeds to determine 
the amount awarded to each youth team. We need the results verified for our 2002 season. Every 
other committee except youth has in place, a written policy to determine what their disbursement 
policy is, how to disburse it, who is eligible, how they apply, who qualifies. We need someone 
or persons willing to go into the data base to extract our eligible youth athletes who actually 
attended the nationals in Omaha. Bob Shor has done this tedious, laborious feat in the past. 
<i>The increase in membership from $15 to $20</i> was because we are running a deficit; even with the 
increase in fees. If you register online there is a 50 cent discount. The $75 team registration fee: 
$25 goes to the national body for insurance, rule books, etc. The remaining amount goes toward the 
general fund to help pay for the expenses of the association which includes the running of the office, 
travel funds and management supplied to the youth track meets at no expense to the youth committee. 
<i>The new athletic director</i> from UC Berkeley anticipates conducting a grand prix decathlete 
championship May 9-10. This is the same weekend as the Modesto Relays.
 
Motion to adjourn; seconded. Meeting adjourned at 9:30. Next meeting - January in Sacramento
