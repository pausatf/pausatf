AADP can also provide assistance to a selected athlete from our
Association. The PA will provide $250 to the woman who receives the
most combined grand prix points at our two Spring 10Ks (Compaq 4/22
and Pacific Sun 5/27) to compete in the Tufts 10K (Oct. 14).
          Travel Funds 2002
                  Providence - Sept.
                  Senior Bowl Mobile

Long distance: provide $250 in travel funds to a women to compete in
a marathon in which they would hope to achieve a marathon trials
standard. Those interested in receiving this travel assistance need
to submit a resume to an appointed committee (to be determined). As
part of the selection process, the committee will strongly consider
whether the applicant has already qualified for the  marathon trials.
Resumes are to be received by the committee by the end of February,
2002 [Note: This deadline has since been extended to the end of
March, 2002].

MEN - the following were unanimously approved:
Short section: Provide $250 in travel funds to the winner of the
Heritage Oaks Bank 10K to compete in the Senior Bowl National 10K
Championship in Mobile Alabama Nov. 2. National AADP will also
provide assistance. Select the leader of the short GP after the Fleet
Feet Capitol Mile to compete in the Providence 5K National
Championship Sept. 15. leader of the short GP after
Long Section: same as for women above.

New Business
Rule Interpretations
a) Does the requirement to compete in the XC Championships in order
to be able to receive year-end prize money apply to teams? The
consensus was Yes, but a 2/3 vote could override. An exception for
the WVTC open women did not achieve 2/3 vote.

b) OOAA (Out of Association Athletes) - if an athlete moves out of
the PA boundaries during the year, should that athlete be allowed to
continue to compete as a PA athlete in the PA's Grand Prix events?
Consensus: Yes.

c) Pre-entry for comped runners in Grand Prix events - Passed that
section 16.3 of the LDR Guidelines be changed to: "Comped athletes
must pre-register by the latest pre-registration date published by
the race or the entry must be postmarked 2 weeks prior to the race
date. No race day comp entries."

d) "Comps only available to those in proper age group>" Unanimously
passed to allow Shirley Matson, Myra Rhodes and Kathleen Atkins to
receive comp entries in different age group categories. Issue will be
considered for a rule change.

e) "Development Fund" - clarification that $50 per multiple of $1300
of prize money offered will be set aside for the athlete development fund.

f) Rhody event prize money breakdown issue: Rhody wants same prize
money breakdown as last year, so he will throw in the extra
developmental money on top, in effect increasing the prize purse.

g) Clarksburg prize money adjusted to 2nd open = $100 and 3d master = $25.

LDR Banquet Update - maybe the end of February.

Potential Shoreline XC protest never materialized.

New award - passed with one opposed that there will be a new annual
award (male/female) for best single performance using the Purdy-Gardner Tables.

Race Day Sign-ups - The LDR Committee will endeavor to send an e-mail
broadcast encouraging pre-race PA/USATF membership registration before
each Grand Prix event.

Charles DesJardins announced that there are plans to have an LDR
referee and a 3-member jury of appeals for each LDR Grand Prix event.

Crystal Springs XC was not scored correctly, resulting in some
changes in overall standings. There were no objections to updating
the standings accordingly.

Meeting adjourned 1:10 pm.
