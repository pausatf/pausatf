INDIANAPOLIS - Jordan Hasay surprised no one in winning the women's
1,500m Friday at the 2007 Finish Line USA Junior Track & Field
Championships at the IU Michael A. Carroll Track & Soccer Stadium on the
campus of IUPUI in downtown Indianapolis.

A high school phenom, Hasay (Arroyo Grande, Calif.) continued to rewrite
the record books, winning the women's 1,500m in a meet, age and
sophomore class record 4 minutes 16.98 seconds. The previous meet record
of 4:18.1 was set in 1977 by Lynn Jennings and Suzy Favor-Hamilton's age
and sophomore class record of 4:19.46 was set in 1992. Hasay's time is
the fastest in 25 years and sits at #4 on the all-time high school list.
2007 NCAA DII West Regional Cross Country champion Jessica Pixler
(Sammamish, Wash.) finished strong for second in 4:20.93. 

Two-time USATF Junior Olympic champion William Wynne (Kennesaw, Ga.) won
the men's 400m hurdles in 49.70. Wynne's time places him second on the
all-time U.S. Junior list. Wynne will next compete in the 110m and 400m
hurdles at the World Youth Championships in July. National High School
record-holder in the 55m hurdles Johnny Dutch (Clayton, N.C.) was the
runner-up in 50.07.

2006 U.S. champion Jessica Beard (Euclid, Ohio) ran away with the title
in the women's 400 meters in 52.12 seconds, over 1 second ahead of
runner-up Brandi Cross (Missouri City, Texas) who finished in 53.33.
Bear and Cross were both members of the 4x400m relay that brought home
the gold medal from the 2006 IAAF World Junior Championships.

On the men's side, 2007 Gatorade National Boys Track & Field Athlete of
the Year Bryshon Nellum (Long Beach, Calif.) dominated the men's 400m,
cruising to victory in 45.38. Western Kentucky freshman Terrill McCombs
(Upper Marlboro, Md.) finished in second in 46.24.

Virginia Tech freshman Queen Quedith Harrison (Richmond, Va.) turned in
a strong performance in winning the women's 400m hurdles in 56.86. Ryann
Krais (Eagleville, Pa.) was second in 57.20 and Jacquelyn Coward
(Knoxville, Tenn.) was third in 57.89.

In a race to the finish, 2006 U.S. Junior champion Andrew (A.J.) Acosta
(Oceanside, Calif.) surged from the back of the lead pack to edge out
2007 Nike Outdoor National 2 mile champion Matt Centrowitz (Broadneck,
Md.) at the finish, winning in 3:49.53 to 3:59.54 respectively. 2007
Nike Outdoor Nationals mile champion Sam Borchers (Yellow Springs, Ohio)
was third in 3:50.23.
