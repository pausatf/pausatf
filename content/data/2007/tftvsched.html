<h2>2007 Track on TV Schedule</h2>
<br>
<br>

<b>What to watch for</b><br> 
Among the highlights of the 2007 season:<br>
* Live coverage of the AT&amp;T USA Indoor Championships in Boston and the AT&amp;T USA Outdoor Championships 
in Indianapolis - where the Team USA roster for the IAAF World Championships will be selected. 
The AT&amp;T USA Outdoor Championships coverage will include four shows on NBC and ESPN2.<br>
* Live and taped coverage on NBC and ESPN2 of the 100th Millrose Games early next month. 
The Millrose Games, which attracts the largest crowd of any indoor track meet in the world, is the 
longest-running continuously staged event in New York's Madison Square Garden and will feature many 
special "Centenary" events in 2007.<br>
* Live coverage of the USA versus the World relay events at the Penn Relays on ESPN2. Last year's 
Penn Relays attracted a three-day crowd of over 114,000 spectators, including 49,000 on the day 
that top American relay teams took on the world's best.<br>
* Live coverage on NBC of the Nike Prefontaine Classic from Eugene, Oregon, site of the U.S. Olympic 
Team Trials -- Track &amp; Field in 2008.<br>
"Our athletes have told us time and again that the best way for them to prepare to take on the 
world's best at the Osaka World Championships and Beijing Olympics is to have high-quality domestic 
competitions with significant prize money and wide public exposure. The Visa Championship Series 
and the TV lineup we announce today continues to provide the opportunities the athletes have been 
seeking," Masback added.<br>
