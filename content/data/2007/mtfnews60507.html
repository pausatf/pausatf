							<p>Sorensen Betters&nbsp; Masters World and U.S. Records for 1,500 Meters</p>
							<p>(June 4, 2007)&nbsp; Jim Sorensen of San Leandro, Calif. became the fastest master (over 40 years-old) competitor in history for the 1,500-meter distance at the Jim Bush Invitational/USATF West Regional Track &amp; Field Championship at Occidental College in Los Angeles last night. Sorensen's mark of 3 minutes 44.06 seconds bettered the official men's age 40 to 44 outdoor world record of 3:46.7 set by David Moorcroft of Great Britain in 1993. Sorensen's time also is under the current men's&nbsp; age 40 to 44 U.S outdoor record of 3:49.82 set by John Hinton in 2004. Sorensen's marks are considered pending records until they are validated by USA Track &amp; Field and World Masters Athletics (WMA).&nbsp;</p>
							<p>Sorensen has rewritten masters record books since he turned 40 on May 10th this year.&nbsp; On May 12th at the Occidental Invitational he ran 1:51.57 for 800 meters, bettering the U.S. outdoor M40-44 record of 1:52.42 set by 4-time Olympian Johnny Gray. He now has his sights on&nbsp; the masters outdoor records for one mile. Moorcroft holds&nbsp; the world outdoor mile record of 4:02.53. Tony Young holds the current U.S. standard of 4:09.61.&nbsp;</p>
							<p>Sorensen, a graduate of Cal Poly San Luis Obispo,&nbsp; was the 1996 U.S. Olympic Track &amp; Field Trials men's 1,500-meter runnerup. He holds lifetime personal bests of 1:47.24 (800 meters). 3:38.65 (1,500 meters), and 3:59.16 (mile). He is sponsored by The Sports Basement of San Francisco. Sorensen currently teaches physical education at Bancroft Middle School (San Leandro, Calif.).</p>
