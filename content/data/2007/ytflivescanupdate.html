PA/USATF will ensure a Live Scan operator will be available at the beginning of the meet to allow 
coaches and parent volunteers who have direct access to youth club athletes to complete a free Live Scan.  
Before completing the Live Scan make sure you have become a 2007 USATF member (bring your USATF # with you).  
Also bring a completed <a href="/data/formssanctions.html">Youth Coach/Volunteer Form</a> with you.  After you complete 
the Live Scan then go to the station set up by Charlie Sheppard to have your picture taken for your badge. 
Once your Live Scan has been verified as acceptable then you can receive your badge from George Paddeck. 
<br><br>
If you have already completed a Live Scan and you have been approved to work with youth athletes but you haven't 
had your picture taken for your badge, then come to this meet to have Charlie take your picture. By the end of 
the meet he will have a printed badge that you can take home. George Paddeck (Buffalo Chips) will be distributing 
the final badge &amp; lanyard. This link goes to a <a href="/data/2007/ybckchks.html">list of 
completed live scan coaches and volunteers</a> background checks.
<br><br>
For 2007 all PA/JO and Region 14 JO Championship meets will require coaches to wear their 2007 PA/USATF Youth badge to 
be recognized as a youth coach.  Without this badge you cannot attend coaches meetings, pick up a club packet w/bib numbers, 
go into the warm-up area or any other location where the athletes are staged. 
<br><br>
Coaches: your youth athletes should also be registered 2007 USATF members to compete in all regular season and 
championship meets.  How do you know if an athlete has registered?  Click on the link titled,  Clubs  in the 
left navigation bar of the home page of the PA/USATF website.  In the menu that displays next click on the 
link titled,  Club List.  Now scroll down till you find the name of your club and click on the blue number 
in the second column under the title,  PA Roster .  You will be taken to a page that displays all adults and 
youth athletes that are current 2007 USATF members and associated with your club.  If a youth athlete is not 
listed on this page prior to the start of any sanctioned USATF meet the athlete cannot compete on a relay 
team for that club.  For all championship meets scheduled this summer, a youth athlete must be a registered 
2007 member to compete.  No exceptions.  Competition bib numbers will not be distributed for non-registered athletes.
