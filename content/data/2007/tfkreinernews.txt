Kreiner sets American record 

After setting the U.S. women's javelin throw record five times in 2006, four-time national champion and 2004 Olympian Kim Kreiner has done it again. 

Kreiner threw 64.19 meters/210 feet 7 inches to win the javelin Wednesday at the 2007 "Grande Pr&ecirc;mio Sul-Americano Caixa/Unifor de Atletismo" in Fortaleza, Brazil. Her performance, which betters her previous AR of 62.44m/204-10, stands as the world's leading women's javelin throw mark this year. 

The 2003 Pan American Games champion, Kreiner finished third at this event last year with a then American record toss of 61.78m/202-8. Kreiner will look to win her fourth consecutive U.S. title at the 2007 AT&T USA Outdoor Track & Field Championships next month in Indianapolis. 

Star-studded field set for Prefontaine Classic men's 200 meters 

A stellar field featuring many of the world's finest men's sprinters will compete in the men's 200 meters June 10 at the 2007 Prefontaine Classic at historic Hayward Field on the campus of the University of Oregon in Eugene. 

The fourth event of USA Track & Field's 2007 Outdoor Visa Championship Series, The Prefontaine Classic will be televised live for two hours on NBC, beginning at 4 p.m. Eastern Time. 

Featured men's sprinters include reigning Olympic 200m champion Shawn Crawford and Xavier Carter, who will be making his first appearance of the season after running a world-leading time of 19.63 seconds last year, which is the second fastest performance in history. He'll be challenged in the 200 meters by Wallace Spearmon, who last year posted the third-fastest 200m time ever of 19.65. 

World and Olympic men's 400m champion Jeremy Wariner, who was named the 2006 USATF Jesse Owens Award winner, will be in the mix, along with 100-meter world record holder Asafa Powell of Jamaica. 

Also look for NCAA 200m runner-up Kelly Willie, 2006 AT&T USA Outdoor Championships third place finisher Rodney Martin and Jamaican veteran Chris Williams, who won the Doha Super Grand Prix 200m last weekend at the age of 35.
