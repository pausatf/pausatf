<b><strong><b><font color="#000080">INDIANAPOLIS</font></b></strong></b> - The USA Track & Field Foundation has presented Elite Athlete 
Development Grants to four athletes, USATF Foundation Executive Director Tom 
Jackovic announced Monday. 

The USATF Foundation Elite Athlete Grant Program contributes to the pursuit of 
world-class performances by American post-collegiate track and field athletes. 
Athletes must meet minimum performance standards to be eligible. 

Athletes receiving $3,000 grants include discus thrower Cecilia Barnes, long 
jumper Shameka Marshall, triple jumper Shani Marks and sprinter/long jumper 
Brianna Glenn. 

2006 Cal State Bakersfield grad Cecilia Barnes is a three-time NCAA DII champion 
in the discus throw. She finished fourth at the 2007 AT&T USA Outdoor Track & Field 
Championships. 

Shameka Marshall won gold in the women's long jump and the 4x100 meters at the 
2007 NACAC Championships after placing sixth in the long jump at the 2007 USA 
Outdoor Championships. 

Shani Marks won back-to-back titles in 2006 and 2007 in the women's triple jump. 
She also is a two-time USA Indoor champion, winning in 2005 and 2007. 

2001 NCAA long jump champion Brianna Glenn set personal bests in 2007 in both the 
long jump and the 100m. She placed fourth in the long jump at the 2007 USA Outdoor 
Championships. 

The USATF Foundation provides a means to attract and guide funds to new and 
innovative track and field programs with an emphasis on providing opportunities 
for youth athletes, emerging elite athletes and anti-doping education. The 
Foundation depends on donations from its Board of Directors and from generous 
fans of track & field. 

The Foundation assists people of all ages, all walks of life, and all ability 
levels in finding enjoyment and accomplishment and achieving fitness through our 
inclusive sport.
