			<p>A strong contingent of Pacific Association track and field athletes posted a number of stellar marks at the 2007 USATF Masters Indoor Championships in Boston at the Reggie Lewis Center, March 23 through 25.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Joy Upshaw-Margerum (46), from Palo Alto, California, led the group with a sparkling American record of&nbsp; 9.13 in the W45 60 meter hurdles, breaking Phil Raschker&sbquo;s 1995 record of 9.18.&nbsp; She added three more gold medals in the 60 meter dash, just missing another of Raschker&sbquo;s American records by .04, the 200 meter dash, where she crossed the line more than 2 seconds ahead of the second place finisher, and the long jump in which outdistanced second place in by almost a full meter.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Finishing second in the hurdles behind Upshaw-Margerum, Liz Palmer (46) had this to say about their run: <b>&bdquo;</b>Joy<b> knew that I wanted to break 10 seconds for the race.&nbsp; So we stood there and watched the scoreboard waiting for our times.&nbsp; When they went up, the <u>first</u> thing she did was congratulate me...never mind about herself breaking the record and I'm sure she was thrilled about that.&nbsp; What a class act.&#x2030; </b></p>
			<p>&bdquo;It was a terrific meet and definitely something fun for most of us on the West Coast, because we don't get to race much indoors.&#x2030; said Upshaw-Margerum.&nbsp; &bdquo;It's as much fun for me to watch the races as it is to race in some, too!&nbsp; It was great to cheer on Leslie Sokol in the W40 race walk, James Hollister in the M60 long jump, Liz Palmer in the W45 pentathlon and see the highly anticipated Aaron Thigpen/Robert Thomas M40 200 meter race&#x2211;it was thrilling!&nbsp; I really enjoy seeing our &quot;Masters&quot; friends from our Pacific Association and around the country perform.&#x2030;&nbsp; <b>&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Palmer, from Folsom, California, returned to track and field competition only two years ago after a 25 year layoff&nbsp; and has her own list of impressive accomplishments from Boston.&nbsp; In addition to silver in the hurdles, she won the gold in the pentathlon<i>,</i> triple, and high jumps, took silver in the 60 dash, long jump, and 4x 400 relay,<i> </i>and 4th in the shot put.&nbsp; All of Palmer&sbquo;s individual marks except the shot put were PRs, including a 3256 point pentathlon and 29-4 triple jump. The gold medal in the pentathlon was her third consecutive national title in that event, and she is only the 3rd American woman over the age of 45 (behind Margerum and Raschker) to break 10 seconds in the 60 meter hurdles.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Newlyweds Larry Barnum (63) and Carmel Papworth-Barnum (41) had some terrific results in their first indoor track appearance as husband and wife.&nbsp; World-champion Barnum continued his comeback from injury with a bronze medal in an extremely close 400 meter race while his bride captured the bronze in the 3,000 meter run, silver in the 4x 400 relay, 4th place in the mile, and 5th in the 800.</p>
			<p>Other notable performances from PA athletes include two gold medals (60 and 200 meters dashes) for 2006 USATF Masters 75-79 Age Group Athlete of the year, Edythe Leeke (76),<i> </i>Aaron Thigpen (42) with gold in the 60 meter dash and silver in the 200, and Carla Kehoe (43) with bronze medal performances in both the mile and 800 and silver in the 4x400 relay.&nbsp; Curtis Moore (39) took home gold in the triple jump and silver in the long jump, James Hollister (62) won gold medals in both the pentathlon and long jump, Dennis Cameron (58) was champion in the weight throw, as was Mary Baglin (60) in the 3000 meter race walk, George Konen (60) won silver in the super weight throw and bronze in the weight throw, and Randy Sturgeon (54) and Robert Qualls (54) struck gold in both the 4x400 and 4x800 relays.&nbsp; Silver medalists include Matt Bogdanowicz (38) in the 800 meter run, Leslie Sokol in the 3000 meter race walk, and Vaso Karras (38 ) in the 4x400, with Reid Harter (56) earning a bronze medal in the 3000 meter run.&nbsp; Congratulations to all!&nbsp;</p>
			<p>A very strong So Cal Track Club claimed the national team title, and Sacramento-based Golden West Athletics Club, coached by Randy Sturgeon, was the top PA club, finishing 10th.&nbsp;&nbsp; &bdquo;I was so thrilled with how we did.&#x2030; said Sturgeon.&nbsp; &bdquo;I was shocked to see how high our point total was.&nbsp; It is very encouraging as far as what we can do with the full team in Orono where we should have 25 to 30 athletes competing. We had a great trip and now on to Maine!&#x2030;&nbsp;</p>
			<p>This year&sbquo;s meet, with over 700 competitors, was highlighted by the announcing of Peter Taylor and superbly organized by Steve Vaitones and the New England Association of the USATF.&nbsp; The atmosphere was electric, and each performance was roundly cheered by spectators and athletes alike!&nbsp;&nbsp; The 2008 Indoor Championships will again take place next March in Boston and the Pacific Association anticipates another excellent meet and great showing by its many fine athletes.&nbsp;</p>
