							<p><font size="3">The 48th annual adidas Golden West Track &amp; Field Invitational is set for Sunday, June 10th at Folsom High School.</font></p>
							<p><font size="3">500 of the Nation's top high school track and field athletes in the country will be in attendance at this year's meet. Over 150 past participants of this meet have gone on to represent the United States in Olympic competition with 40 of them winning gold medals! This list includes names like Steve Prefontaine, Jim Ryun, Bob Beamon, Tommie Smith, Evelyn Ashford, Marion Jones, Monique Henderson and Stacy Dragila just to name a few.</font></p>
							<p><font size="3">In addition to Olympic glory, many of these athletes have had stellar NFL football careers including Hall of Famer Terry Bradshaw who threw the javelin in high school, Lynn Swan, Mel Renfo, Art Monk, Bob Hayes and Michael Carter who stills holds the National and Golden West meet record in the shot put.</font></p>
							<p><font size="3">This year's crop of great athletes will include Tori Anthony of Woodside CA who holds the National Indoor record in the pole vault at 14'2&quot;, Walter Henning of Kings Park NY who holds the National record in the hammer, and our own Alex Kosinski of El Dorado Hills who holds the National record in the 1600 meters.</font></p>
							<p><font size="3">The hammer and javelin will take place early in the morning starting at 8 am while the running events and the rest of the field events will start at 4 pm. Tickets are available at the stadium for $10 for adults and $5 for students with kids under 14 getting in free.</font></p>
							<p><font size="3">In addition to a great track meet having the adidas Golden West Meet in Folsom is good for business too and helps fill area hotels bringing in thousands of dollars in tourism to this area. The Folsom Tourism Bureau is one of the meet's sponsors in addition to adidas.</font></p>
							<p><font size="3">For those wishing to see the action up close and personnel you can volunteer and receive a free meet T-shirt. Please contact the USA Track &amp; Field office in Folsom at PAUSATF@aol.com or call 916-983-4715.</font></p>
