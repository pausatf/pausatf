<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">	There was no official
meeting at the NCAA Championships on June 7, 2007 because a quorum
was not present. However, Michael Boot took some notes at the
unofficial meeting (not distributed yet).</P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Committee Reports:</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">	Awards. Dr. Leon
Glover.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">		Dr. Glover thought
the group receiving awards was quite good but expressed
disappointment in the number of awardees at the Annual meeting that
did not show to accept their awards in spite of his e-mailing each
person and also calling them on the phone. He has sent all the awards
to the no-shows. Dr. Glover is again accepting nominations for awards
for the coming year. George Kleeman passed around representations of
the Hall of Fame Award for the committee members to vote on which one
should be awarded to the individuals inducted into the Hall of Fame:
Lori Maynard, Sonny Maynard, Dr. Brown, Tom Moore, Horace Crowe and
George Kleeman.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">	Certification: Jim
Hume.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">		Nothing seems to be
happening with national in the way of certifications, especially in
the area of electronic measuring, recording and judging. Jim Hume
pointed out that he should have been certified in this field a long
time ago and all the names submitted from the NCAA championships this
summer have received no action from national as far as he can
determine. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">	Jim Hume fielded a
question from Dick Connors regarding two individuals who became
certified this past year but are not listed as members on the
spreadsheet kept by Jim Hume. It was pointed out that becoming
certified in no way makes a person a member. Membership depends upon
payment of membership fees each year and if those fees are not paid,
they will not be reported as members for purposes of mailings and
other benefits of membership of PAUSATF. George Kleeman pointed out
that there are presently about 15 to 20 individuals who claim to be
members but are not certified, ie., they never went through the
process to become recertified at the beginning of the Olympiad. There
seems to be three classifications of people in the organization at
present: Those that have paid their membership and are certified;
those that paid membership but are not certified and those that are
certified but have not paid their membership. It was agreed that the
two individuals in question would be further researched by the
certification chair. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">	Training: George
Kleeman</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">		There are 42
potential clinics for 2008. What is needed now is to finalize the
dates and schedules, which subject will be taken up in Old Business.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">	Annual Meeting:</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">		Mike Leonard moved to
schedule the annual meeting for September 7, 2008. Seconded by Jim
Hume. In favor: ALL</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Old Business:</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">	Training Clinics:</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">		Basically, George
Kleeman said, he and his committee need some direction from this
board on what direction they should go in.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">		The subcommittee
received about 20 responses from the approximately 300 surveys that
were sent out.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">		INTRODUCTORY CLINIC:	
There will be a general introductory clinic taking up both the
morning and afternoon sessions with the certification exam at the
end. This clinic will not be as specific and detailed on specific
events as introductory clinics in the past. After becoming certified,
the member may then take a more specific second tiered advance basic
clinic in either Track or Field events. These clinics will be only a
morning or afternoon session and it is hoped the member will avail
himself/herself of these clinics only after some exposure to track
and field the first year after becoming certified. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">		For some modicum of
uniformity and consistency of information conveyed in all clinics, it
is planned to have a central place to store outlines of the
individual clinics submitted by the instructors and available to all
the instructors. The idea is that the instructors are to write down
the goals of the clinic he/she leads and the outline and material
used in the clinic. This is a 5 year plan to collect these outlines
headed up by Dennis Boyle at the present. Also included in this phase
of the project are Jim Hume, Shirley Connors, Dick Connors, Bruce
Colman, Margaret Sheehan and George Kleeman.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">		Next year, after the
Bejing Olympics, will be a re-certification year and plans must be
made for how we will conduct the re-certification. It is proposed
that the clinics will be done in groups as was done last time.
Instead of multiple tests for individuals, a person being recertified
will only take one test &ndash; at the highest level of certification
he/she has obtained or applying for. New this time will be a Referee
exam with 5 association level exams.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">		Rule Books: John Wise
and Phil Leake have agreed to handle obtaining and distributing rule
books this year. Members may obtain rule books by buying directly
from the publisher (NCAA, etc.) or online through active.com which
will add $2 and those books can be  delivered to the member at a
clinic. If the member wants it mailed to them there will be a $2
handling fee added to the cost. If there are any &ldquo;extra&rdquo;
books they will be on sale at the clinics on a first come, first
serve basis, usually sold out after the ARC clinics. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">		George Kleeman has
already prepared both the Association level and National level test
for USATF and they will be available by December 31, 2007. These
tests can be used by the various associations if they choose. Jim
Hume is requesting help from Master level officials in preparing our
own tests. There will be a new officials test which will have the
book and page number where the answer can be found and the
association level test which will have the same type of questions but
the member will have to find the answer in the appropriate book by
themselves.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">		Dick Connors
questioned the giving a clinic &ldquo;Youth vs High School Rules&rdquo;.
 George Kleeman responded that the clinics that are listed are the
ones that were requested through the survey his committee sent to the
membership. If there are any that should not be taught or should be
changed, that can be accomplished. Dick Connors emphasized that a
curriculum should be developed for each clinic geared to the learner
and the instructors should not preach. Once the curriculum is
established the instructor then must determine how he/she will teach
the subject. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">		George Kleeman stated
that no manuals will be given out at the introductory classes.
However, all participants at the introductory classes will get all
three rule books (High School, NCAA and USATF, a $29 value, which
will be included in the $35 registration fee. This is an increase of
$10 over last year but all three rule books will be included. Manuals
will not be provided at the upper level clinics but will be online
and the instructors can print them out and copy them for the clinic
or the students can do the same.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">		George Kleeman
pointed out if active.com is used for the purchase of books, there
will be a service fee of $3 per transaction. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">		After discussion it
was decided that the Introductory Clinic would cost $35 per
registrant if pre registered and $45 if registering at the door.
Referee, Hy-Tek and Advance Basic Clinics would cost $13 pre
registered and $23 at the door. All other clinics would cost $8 pre
registered and $18 at the door. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">		Jim Hume indicated
that he had heard that there were problems using active.com but he
did not have any specifics about what the problems may be. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">		John Murray moved to
adopt active.com for registration for clinics and for purchasing rule
books for the minimum period of the contract. Dick Connors seconded
the motion.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">		Discussion: Jim Hume
asked if there were any other services like active.com. Bruce Colman
indicated that there were but this was the most used one for what we
were doing.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">			Jon Siegel asked if
the information regarding registration could be downloaded more than
one time. George Kleeman indicated that the information remains on
the server and those with access can download the same information as
many times as he/she wants.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">			Mike Leonard raised
the issue of what ID theft security features are in place to protect
our members. Bruce Colman and George Kleeman assured that the
information that would be on the server would be minimal and
active.com has systems installed to protect against ID theft. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">		George Kleeman called
the question. In Favor: All</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">	Bruce Colman suggested
the Executive Committee should resolve to thank the Training
Committee for the hard work they have put in and their dedication. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">	Jim Hume moved the
above resolution. Mike Leonard seconded. In Favor: All.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">NEW BUSINESS</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">	Membership Renewal:
George Kleeman</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">		George Kleeman,
somewhat exasperated asked, &ldquo;How do we encourage members to pay
their dues?&rdquo; The only answers the Executive Committee could
come up with was by information in <I>Turns and Distances</I>
informing the reader how to renew online. Also there will be a coupon
in <I>Turns and Distances</I> that the member can fill out and send
to USATF. Bruce Colman said he was going to email every member with
an email address reminding him/her to renew. As a last resort, in
March, Jim Hume, Bruce Colman and George Kleeman will &ldquo;chase
the strays.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">	Web Redesign: John
Lilygren</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">		John Lilygren
indicated that he and J. R. Heberle are working on a redesign of the
Officials Page of the PAUSATF web site. He indicated that the entire
web site is being redesigned and our redesign will have to be in
conformance with the overall design. The board was given a preview of
the progress of the design thanks to George Kleeman setting up his
projector and computer. The board was impressed with the development
of the web page. It was also indicated that the present PAUSATF web
page will have a link to the 2008 clinics and book purchases.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">		RESOLUTION:  The
PAUSATF Officials Executive Board resolves that John Lilygren should
continue to develop a prototype page to be used when PAUSATF finishes
redesigning its web site.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">		In favor: ALL</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">	The clinic schedule
