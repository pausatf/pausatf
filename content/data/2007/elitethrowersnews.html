								<p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE </p>

								<p>COEUR D’ALENE, Idaho, April 2, 2007 – Bart Templeman, founder of Iron Wood Throwers, an Idaho-based non-profit organization dedicated to the advancement of American athletes and coaches in the throwing events of track and field, today announced the anticipated field of competitors for the inaugural Maui “Big Wind” Discus Challenge. Former US Olympians <b>Stephanie Brown-Trafton</b>, Casey Malone, <b>Suzy Powell-Roos</b>, Jarred Rome, and Ian Waltz will join fellow elite American post-collegiate discus throwers Cecilia Barnes, Becky Breisch, Karl Erickson, Beth Mallory-Lesch, and Nick Petrucci for the meet series to be staged on Saturday, April 14th and Monday, April 16th at the historic War Memorial Stadium Complex in Wailuku, Hawaii.</p>
								<p>“We look forward to providing a one-of-a-kind competitive experience for these great athletes,” said Templeman. “With its ideal climate and strong prevailing winds, there is simply no other place in the world that can rival Maui in its ability to provide such great natural resources for elite discus throwing.”</p>
								<p>For a majority of these athletes the competition series will serve as the starting point to their 2007 season. Undoubtedly all will be seeking to harness the power of the legendary Hawaiian trade winds to surpass the current IAAF “A” standard (64.50m/211-7 for men, 61.00m/200-1 for women), an essential step required to become eligible for obtaining a coveted spot on the US National team for the 11th annual IAAF World Championships in Athletics to be held in Osaka, Japan. Also at stake are the long-standing American and World Records:</p>
								<p> </p>
								<p><b>Men’s Discus</b></p>
								<p>American Record: Ben Plucknett, SC Striders, 72.34m/237-4 (1981)</p>
								<p>World Record: Jurgen Schult, German Democratic Republic, 74.08m/243-0 (1986)</p>
								<p><b>Women’s Discus</b></p>
								<p>American Record: Carol Cady, Stanford TC, 66.10m/216-10 (1986)</p>
								<p>World Record: Gabriele Reinsch, German Democratic Republic, 76.80m/251-11 (1988)</p>
								<p>“We’re excited to participate in such a great event and hope to utilize it as a springboard for a very successful 2007 season, which is by far the most critical year prior to the Olympics,” remarked Bud Rasmussen, discus chairman for the USA Track &amp; Field Men’s Development Committee and personal coach to Breisch, Erickson, Rome, and Waltz.</p>
