						  <p>THE IAAF'S NEW SERIES &quot;ROAD RUNNING SHOW&quot; TOES THE START LINE</p>
						  <p>19 December 2007</p>
						  <p>Monte-Carlo - The IAAF's much awaited televised road running magazine<br>
						    will commence broadcasting at the beginning of 2008.</p>
						  <p>The RUNNING ROAD SHOW will visit over 50 countries and will broadcast an<br>
						    all year round entertainment show with 50 weekly episodes covering a<br>
						    variety of topics from lifestyle to competition updates and runner<br>
						    profiles, meeting the world's greatest runners and reliving the world's<br>
						    greatest road races.</p>
						  <p>The RUNNING ROAD SHOW is for runners, their families and fans and is<br>
						    intended to link the entire road running world from elite performers to<br>
						    the club runner to the everyday jogger.  The show will provide tips, news<br>
						    and features of interest to the entire community, from participants who<br>
						    have a life-long passion for running to novices who perhaps see training<br>
						    for and running a marathon as a once in a lifetime challenge or a charity<br>
						    fundraiser.</p>
						  <p>The TV magazine which was officially launched this autumn at Sportel,<br>
						    Monaco has FOX  as its Commercial Partner in a deal that will run through<br>
						    2008 with an option to continue for further years.</p>
						  <p>&quot;Road running is the most populous, diverse branch of our sport, its<br>
						    number of participants and competition structure making it unique,&quot;<br>
						    commented IAAF President Diack. &quot;What other major sport offers<br>
						    recreational participants the possibility to compete alongside elite<br>
						    performers as occurs at the world's major city road races.  The average<br>
						    footballer can't play with Ronaldo, but the average jogger can toe the<br>
						    start line with Radcliffe.&quot;</p>
						  <p>&quot;The IAAF wishes to strengthen its connections with and further help to<br>
						    promote this mass movement. The RUNNING ROAD SHOW is a dynamic new tool<br>
						    for achieving this goal by offering attractive TV to the road running<br>
						    community, by providing vital year-round TV coverage.&quot;</p>
						  <p>Fox Sports International Vice President of Programme Sales Marcia<br>
						    Bylicki added:  &quot;We are honoured to be working together with such a<br>
						    prestigious Federation as the IAAF, and look forward to being a part of<br>
						    the huge community of road running.&quot;</p>
						  <p>Based in Los Angeles, Fox Sports International (FSI) is an international<br>
						    sports programming and production entity housed within the Fox Cable<br>
						    Networks Group, one of the major operating units within News Corporation<br>
						    (NYSE: NWS).  FSI operates the programming service Fox Soccer Channel, as<br>
						    well as a London-based programming syndication sales division, and is<br>
						    partnered with Global Television in Fox Sports World Canada. It joined<br>
						    with HM Capital Partners, LLC to form Fox Pan American Sports LLC, one of<br>
						    the world's largest Spanish-language sports operations and programming<br>
						    ventures, spanning North, Central and South America, as well as the<br>

						    Spanish-language sports network Fox Sports en Espa&Ograve;ol.</p>
