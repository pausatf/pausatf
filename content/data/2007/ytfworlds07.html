              <strong>PACIFIC ASSOCIATION YOUTH ATHLETES WIN MEDALS AT IAAF WORLD YOUTH CHAMPIONSHIPS</strong>
              <br>
              FOLSOM, Calif. - July 15, 2007
              <br>
              <br>
              - Pacific Association/USA Track &amp; Field youth athletes <strong>Julian Purvis</strong> and <strong>Ashton Purvis</strong>, both of Oakland, Calif., and <strong>Jordan Hasay</strong> of Arroyo Grande, Calif. all won medals over five days at the of the IAAF World Youth Championships in Athletics (track and field) in Ostrava, Czech Republic, July 11-15. Julian Purvis, age 16, won a gold medal in the Girls 100-meter hurdles, defeating favorite Shermaine Williams of Jamaica. Purvis won in a personal best of 13.41 seconds ahead of Williams (13.48).

              <br>
              "When I came to the Czech Republic I was a bit nervous and shaky," said Purvis who plans to focus her education on broadcasting communication. "I also had problems with my asthma and after the heats I was a little bit tired but I said to myself: come on, do your best, you are part of the world champs. My parents helped me a lot but they want me to stay humble and modest. I love what I do."
              <br>
              <br>
              The younger Purvis sister, Ashton Purvis, competed on Team USA's gold-medal-winning Girls Medley Relay team which crossed the finish line in 2:05.74, ahead of Jamaica (2:06.77). Ashton also placed fifth in the Girls 200-meter final (23.89) after winning her semifinal heat in 23.66. In addition, Ashton was seventh in the Girls' 100-meter final (12.04) on the same day (July 12th) that she celebrated her 15th birthday. The Purvis sisters compete for the East Oakland Youth Development Center.

              California distance star Jordan Hasay ran a savvy race on the way to a silver medal and her second-fastest time ever in the 1,500-meter race with a time of 4 minutes, 17.24 seconds. Hasay ran at the front of the pack for most of the race and had to escape the team tactics of Kenyans Sheila Kiprotich and Sammary Cherotich midway through the first lap. The 15-year-old U.S. junior 1,500 champion surged to the front through 800m in 2:16.08, and ran a 2:18.6 final 800m to finish second to Kiprotich. "This didn't really go according to my race plan," said Hasay, who competes for the San Luis Distance Club. "I was going to let the Kenyans lead, but I just kind of went for it when I saw they were teaming up on me. My legs were getting pretty heavy at the end and I just tried to hang on. It is my first international trip, and it is a good experience. It's good to be here away from the usual pressure."
              <br>
              <br>
              In mid May, USA Track &amp; Field selected Hasay and the Purvis sisters for the prestigious Team USA youth squad that competed in Ostrava. Thandi Stewart (Union City, Calif.), age 15, was also selected, but did not complete due to injury. Team USA topped the medal table with 14 medals (7 gold, 4 silver, and 3 bronze) with Kenya in second with 11 medals (6-4-1) and Russia in third with 10 medals (4-3-3). Final Championships figures: 152 countries, 1228 athletes (672 boys, 556 girls), 580 officials.
