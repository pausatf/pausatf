<p>FOLSOM, Calif. - September 4, 2007 - Athletes with Pacific Association/USA Track & Field (PA/USATF) ties competed at the IAAF World Outdoor Track & Field Championships, held August 25-September 2 in Osaka, Japan. A summary of their performances follows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2004 Olympian Paul Terek (San Luis Obispo, Calif.) placed 10th in the decathlon with 8,120 points. Jake Arnold, a Santa Rosa, Calif. native (Mario Carrillo High School) and two-time NCAA champion, finished 13th with 8,004 points.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"It wasn't the performance that I wanted and the place I wanted," said Terek. "I had a lot of bigger aspirations especially since it was so wide open after Bryan Clay and Tom Pappas dropped out. I'd rather have a great meet and finish well and have everybody there."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Arnold said, "I'm so happy to come out here and score 8,000. I had a great first day. The second day was real rough to get through. I'm looking forward to the [Olympic] Trials."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Three-time Olympian and six-time USA champion Amy Acuff (Isleton, Calif.) placed 12th in the women's high jump with a best clearance of 1.94 meters/6 feet, 4.25 inches. It was Acuff's 8th appearance in the World Championships, and her 7th final.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I felt like a cooked rice noodle today," Acuff said about Osaka's high temperatures and humidity after her qualifying round. After the high jump final, she said: "I just didn't jump high enough today. I felt like I had a lot of power. I just wasn't real smooth or real precise."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In other action:</p>
<p>Women's Discus Throw: American record holder Suzy Powell (Modesto, Calif.) failed to advance to the final, finishing 8th in her qualifying section with a best throw of 59.57m/195-5. Cecilia Barnes (Fresno, Calif.), a 3-time NCAA Division II discus throw champion for Cal State Bakersfield, had a best toss of 53.02m/173-11 for 13th in her qualifying section.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Women's Shot Put: Three-time USA Outdoor champion Kristin Heaston (Walnut Creek, Calif., now residing in Auburn, Ala.), placed 10th in her qualifying section (17.40m/57-1), and did not advance.</p>

<p>Women's 800 Meters: 2007 NCAA Division I champion Alysia Johnson (Canyon Country, Calif., UC-Berkeley) did not advance to the final with a 4th place time of 2 minutes, 2.11 seconds in Heat 2 of qualifying.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I think I may have let up a little too much in the backstretch, and I couldn't get my legs moving quick enough [over the final stretch]," Johnson said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Men's Long Jump: 2002 World Junior bronze medalist Trevell Quinley (Sacramento, Calif.), successfully made it through qualifying, but in the final he fouled on three attempts and had no mark.</p>

<p>Men's High Jump: 2004 Olympic Games 4th placer Jamie Nieto (Valley High School and Sacramento City College, currently residing in Chula Vista, Calif.) finished 8th in his qualifying section with a 2.26m/7-5 jump and did not advance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, Team USA, which finished first in the medals table, had a superb World Outdoor Championships. At the close of competition, the U.S. tied the all-time World Outdoor Championships record for gold medals with 14, matching its feat from 2005, and tied the American all-time medals tally at a World Outdoor Championships with 26.
