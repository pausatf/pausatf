								<p>Pacific Association's Mark Lantz, 42, was crowned USATF National Masters <br>
									champion at the Where's Waldo 100K in Oregon on August 18. Lantz, of <br>
									Folsom, finished third overall among a field of 122 runners, in a time of<br>
									10:56:13, less than eight minutes behind the overall winner. The race is <br>
									conducted annually along single-track mountain trail starting at the<br>
									Willamette Pass 70 miles east of Eugene, and was serving for the first <br>
									time as the USA Masters Trail 100K championship.  <br>
									<br>
									Two-time defending PA Ultrarunner of the Year Beverly Anderson-Abbs, 43, <br>
									of Red Bluff, was the runner-up in the women's race, finishing just <br>
										behind Lantz in 11:09:08 (fourth in overall field).<br>
									<br>
										Lantz was thrilled with his win.<br>
									<br>
									&quot;I was especially proud of the run since I lost 40 minutes because of <br>
									course [-marking] tampering by some mean hikers.&quot;<br>
									<br>
									As a result of this increasingly common problem plaguing backcountry <br>
										ultras, Lantz was unsure of his location on the course.<br>
									<br>
									&quot;I caught Bev and [PA/USATF runner and third-place USATF] Mark Murray up <br>
									the last climb, as Mark explained where I was and told me to put the <br>
									hammer down. It was my best performance, period,&quot; Lantz exclaimed, &quot;and<br>
									that course is soft, shaded, and just a blast to run.&quot;</p>
								<p>Mark Murray finished fifth overall, fourth in the USATF masters men's <br>
									division and seventh overall(11:15:46). Other PA finishers included <br>
									6th male o'all, 5th USATF), Lee McKinley (12:16:21, 8th male o'all, <br>
									6th USATF), Tina Ure (13:12:52, 6th woman o'all, 3rd USATF), <br>
									Stephen Itano (13:58:26, 35th male overall, 15th USATF).</p>
