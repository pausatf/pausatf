BOSTON - Breaking records has become routine for Nadine O'Connor,<br>
							
Kathryn Martin and Phil Raschker, but continuing to rewrite the record<br>
							
books never gets &quot;old&quot; for these three masters legends. They proved that<br>
							
Saturday afternoon at the 2007 USA Masters Indoor Track &amp; Field<br>
							Championships, while <b>Joy Upshaw Margerum</b> proved that records - even<br>
							
those of Raschker - are made to be broken.<br>
							
 <br>
							
O'Connor (Del Mar, Calif.) broke her second listed world record in as<br>
							
many days on Saturday, leaping 4.16m/13-6.75 in the W65 long jump to<br>
							
follow up on the pole vault world record she set Friday.<br>
							
 <br>
							
Martin, of Northport, N.Y., set her second American record of the meet<br>
							
on Saturday by running 5:27.89 to win the W55 mile. The recently minted<br>
							
55-year-old and 2004 USATF masters athlete of the year also broke the<br>
							
W55 American record in the 3,000m on Friday night (10:35.76).<br>
							<br>
							<b>
							
Margerum, whose family includes world-class long jumpers in her father<br>
								
Monte (who in 1954 broke Jesse Owens' high school LJ record) and 2004<br>
								
Olympian sister Grace, has made a name for herself in just a few years<br>
								
competing as a masters athlete. Saturday at the Reggie Lewis Center, the<br>
								
46-year-old track coach from Palo Alto, Calif., ran 8.13 in the 60m<br>
								
hurdles, breaking the W45 American record of 9.18 set by Raschker in<br>
								
1995. Two years ago, at age 44, Upshaw-Margerum set the W40 record<br>
								
(9.08). In the 60m sprint on Saturday, she just missed another Raschker<br>
								
AR when she ran 8.06 seconds, just .04 off of Raschker's record, and she<br>
								also won the long jump (5.22m/17-1.5)</b>.<br>
							<br>
							<b>
							
That Raschker's records are no longer untouchable is a testament to the<br>
								
rapidly growing strength of women's masters competition, according to<br>
								Upshaw-Margerum: &quot;It used to be just the girls in Europe competing,&quot; she<br>
								said. &quot;But now, with the fitness craze, things are getting a lot more<br>
								serious.&quot; As for breaking Raschker's records, &quot;It adds something to<br>
								
shoot for. I have a good relationship with Phil. She likes that she put<br>
								it out there for us to go for, and I've gotten a few or her records.&quot;</b><br>
							<br>
							
Raschker, of Marietta, Ga., continued her W60 record march on Saturday<br>
							
with American records in the 60 meters (8.87) and long jump<br>
							
(4.37m/14-4), where all six of her attempts were well past the American<br>
							
record. She also won the 60m hurdles (10.16). She had broken two world<br>
							
records and four American records during Friday's competition.<br>
							
 <br>
							
More records came from Pay Carstensen of Spring Hill, Florida, who<br>
							
posted a mark of 14.00m/45-11.25 in the weight throw for an M75 American<br>
							
record. Betty Jarvis of Aberdeen, N.C., set her second record of the<br>
							
meet with an American record in the W91 shot put (3.77m/12-4.5). Milan<br>
							
Jamrich of Houston broke the American record in the M55 high jump with a<br>
							
clearance of 1.73m/5-8, and 57-year-old Nolan Shaheed of Pasadena,<br>
							
Calif., ran a 4:26.7 hand-timed 1,500m during his mile race to break the<br>
							
American record in M55.<br>
							
 <br>
							
Alamo, Texas, resident Ralph Maxwell improved the listed long jump<br>
							
American record in the M85 age group to 3.25m/10-8 - a remarkable leap<br>
							
for the 87-year-old.<br>
							
 <br>
							
More Friday-night records<br>
							
 <br>
							
Friday night's 3,000-meter races turned up a host of records that were<br>
							
submitted on Saturday. They included American records by M35 Eric Green<br>
							
(Pontiac, Mich., 9:00.06); M55 Nolan Shaheed (Pasadena, Calif.,<br>
							
9:10.27); W55 Kathryn Martin (Northport, N.Y., 10:35); W65 Marie-Louise<br>
							
Michelsohn (New York, N.Y., 12:034.78). Also in Friday action, M60 John<br>
							
Altendorf set a pending AR in the men's pole vault with a clearance of<br>
							
3.93m/12-10.75).<br>
