<br>
<br>FOLSOM, Calif. - July 24, 2007 - Rising ultrarunning stars Molly Zurn and 
<br>Pacific Association/USATF's Jasper Halekas conquered both the challenging 
<br>course and the competition at the 2007 USA Track &amp; Field 100 Mile Trail 
<br>Championship, hosted by the Tahoe Rim Trail 100 on July 21. The course 
<br>consisted of two tours of a 50-mile trail route mostly along a 
<br>northeastern segment of the 165-mile Tahoe Rim Trail. Competitors 
<br>traversed the crest of the Tahoe Basin between Spooner Lake and Tahoe 
<br>Meadows near Mt. Rose (Nev.), at elevations ranging between 7,000 and 9,200 feet. 
<br>
<br>Blessed by mild weather both day and night, both champions established 
<br>new course records en route to earning an even split of the $2,000 total 
<br>winner's purse. Zurn, 36, formerly of San Francisco and currently of 
<br>Reno, Nev., made history by becoming the first woman to crack the 24-hour 
<br>barrier here, finishing only her third 100-miler in 23 hours, 32 minutes, 
<br>12 seconds. Kim Gimenez, 42, of Long Beach, Calif. was second among women 
<br>in 24:47:59. 
<br>
<br>Halekas, 30, of Oakland, Calif. shattered his own Tahoe Rim Trail 100 
<br>standard from 2006 by over two hours. He felt strong after cruising 
<br>through the first 50 miles in 8:32. Then Halekas powered over the 
<br>course's final challenge, a second ascent of 9,200-foot Snow Valley Peak 
<br>(mile 93), when he realized he would bag the course record. He blasted 
<br>downhill to do exactly that, in 18:16:01. Oakland's Mark Gilligan, 36, 
<br>was second in 19:38:00. 
<br>
<br>There were 69 finishers in the 100-mile national championship event, and 
<br>over 250 finishers in the companion Tahoe Rim Trail 50-mile and 
<br>50-kilometers races. The event was jointly presented by the Tahoe 
<br>Mountain Milers (Lake Tahoe) and Sagebrush Stompers (Carson City) Running 
<br>Clubs.
