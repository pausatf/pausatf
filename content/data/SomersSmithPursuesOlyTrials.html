<b><strong>Note:</strong></b> Linda Somers Smith, 46, of Arroyo Grande, Calif. is hoping to qualify for her 
SIXTH consecutive U.S. Olympic Marathon Trials race, all with the Trials "A" standard, 
an achievement only matched by 1984 Olympic marathon champion Joan Benoit Samuelson. 
The P.F. Chang's Rock 'n' Roll Arizona Marathon on January 13 may be Somers Smith's 
last opportunity.  Last October, she chose to withdraw partway through an unseasonably 
hot LaSalle Bank Chicago Marathon. Somers Smith was a member of the 1996 U.S. women's 
Olympic Marathon team and was the 1993 and 1994 U.S. women's national marathon champion.

<i>Professional Field Announced for Fifth Annual P.F. Chang's Rock 'n' Roll Arizona 
Marathon Running Down a Dream: 39 American women from 19 states take a decisive
step towards Olympic glory</i>

PHOENIX, (Jan. 8, 2008) - The fifth annual P.F. Chang's Rock 'n' Roll Arizona 
Marathon & 1/2 Marathon on Sunday, January 13, 2008 will host an Ethiopian dominated 
professional field and shine the spotlight on 39 American women from 19 states who are 
"Running Down a Dream" as they race for a position at the 2008 U.S. Olympic Team 
Trials - Women's Marathon.

Without Terefe Yae, the 2007 men's champion, in this year's field, Ethiopian Dejene 
Yirdawe, 29, who finished third at the 2007 Dublin Marathon in a personal best time 
of 2 hours, 11 minutes, 8 seconds, represents the fastest time in this year's Arizona 
field.

Haron Toroitich of Kenya set the men's course record of 2:10:33 at the inaugural 
P.F. Chang's Rock 'n' Roll Arizona Marathon in 2004. However, the absence of Kenyan 
representation will be sadly noticed in 2008 after protests and ethnically charged 
riots swept across the East African nation in late December. As a result, many of 
the Kenyan athletes have had to restrict their travel and suspend their training 
in the wake of the violent unrest.

<i>"We send our hopes for a quick cessation to the violence and our prayers for the 
safety of all our friends and their families in Kenya,"</i> said Tracy Sundlun, 
Executive Vice President for Elite Racing. <i>"All our Elite Racing events have been 
blessed over the years to have great Kenyan athletes on our start lines. They are 
not only fantastic runners, but very kind and friendly people. We will run on Sunday 
with them in our hearts."</i>

Joining the men from their training grounds in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, is 25-year-old 
women's champion Adanech Zekiros who returns to defend her 2007 title against second 
place finisher Salomie Getnet, 20. Zekiros ran uncontested across the finish line in 
2:31:43, nearly missing the course record of 2:31:33 set by Shitaye Gemechu in 2004.

Zekiros and Getnet will push the pace against a large field of American women focused 
on qualifying for the 2008 U.S. Olympic Team Trials - Women's Marathon, scheduled for 
Boston on Sunday April 20, the day before the annual Boston Marathon. As part of this 
special invitational program at the P.F. Chang's Rock 'n' Roll Arizona Marathon titled 
'Running Down a Dream', 39 athletes hope to run under the U.S. Olympic Trials "B"
standard time of 2:47:00 to secure a position in Boston.

Some of the American women selected to this year's field include Linda Somers Smith, 
46, of Arroyo Grande, California, a member of the 1996 U.S. Olympic Marathon team, 
and 1994 U.S. national marathon champion.  Linda is gunning for a fifth appearance in 
the Olympic Marathon Trials.

Joining Linda will be 38 year-old Becky Sondag of Casper, Wyoming who missed the 
Olympic Trials "B" standard by just 25 seconds last fall when she finished 12th at 
the Philadelphia Marathon.  In 2000 Becky missed qualifying by only four seconds.

Representing the new generation will be Arizona's Sally Meyerhoff, 24, from Tempe. 
This two-time NCAA All-American at Duke University now coaches cross country and is 
a substitute teacher at her high school alma mater, Mountain Pointe High School. 
Sally will be making her marathon debut in the Valley of the Sun. However, she ran 
1:16:39 at the 2007 AFC Half Marathon in San Diego, good for 5th place, and a time 
that bodes well for her Olympic Trials chances.

<i>"This is likely the last opportunity for these women to qualify for the Trials"</i>, said 
Sundlun. <i>"The P.F. Chang's Rock 'n' Roll Arizona Marathon course has the potential to 
be very fast and the weather should be ideal, and we hope it helps many of these 
athletes get to Boston in April."</i>
