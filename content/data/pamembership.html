<b>REMINDER TO ALL PACIFIC ASSOCIATIONS CLUB MEMBERS </b><br>

Please remember that all club representatives need to check BEFORE an event that their athletes are current PA members AND are currently affiliated with the club in the PA database. You can easily check your roster by going to <a href="http://www.usatf.org/assoc/pacific/data/ClubList.asp">www.usatf.org/assoc/pacific/data/ClubList.asp</a> Or click on Clubs in the front page menu, then click on PA/USATF Club List. </p>

<p><b>Do not leave this important verification until the last minute.</b> The 

on-line club roster is  updated frequently, but not daily. If you are 

uncertain if an athlete is properly affiliated with your club, you 

can call the PA office before the event at 916-983-4715. On the day 

of the event, PA officials are usually available to take pre-race 

registrations, BUT WE CAN'T ABSOLUTELY GUARANTEE THIS.

			Courses need to be accurate to insure you that your next personal record (PR) is truly better than your last one. The USATF certifies course distances, sets timing standards, and maintains running records.</p>

			Get plugged into a large, regional information network that tells you about the best local races and introduces you to USATF-registered running clubs that offer experienced coaches, group practices, runs, and social functions. USATF members are linked to the national USATF office and the USATF Road Running Information Center. Both can provide useful information on a variety of running-related matters. <br>
