<font face="Comic Sans MS">

THERE ARE THREE LEVELS OF CERTIFICATION.

<br><br>



When first certified, you will be an <i><u>Association Level</u></i> official.<br>

As an Association Official, each year you will receive a<i> schedule</i> of meets 

in the Pacific Association; <i>news</i> about clinics and other training sessions;

 <i>invitations</i> to work local and regional youth, high school, college and open

 track and field meets along with periodic mailings of the Pacific Officials Newsletter, 

“Turns &amp; Distances.”

<br><br>

You can start to specialize in the event or events that you like best.  After a few years’ 

service, you can apply to become a <i><u>National Level</u></i> official. Now you will

receive an application to officiate at National Championships and you’ll be invited to 

work high-level invitational meets.

<br><br>

A few more years’ service and you can apply to become a <i><u>Master Level</u></i> official in

your favorite discipline(s). You’ll be eligible to work at national championships and international 

events (like Olympics or Pan Am Games) held on U.S. soil.

<br><br>

WHAT WILL YOU GET BACK?

<br><br>

If you are already helping with your children’s meets, the certification process, and officials’

clinics later on, will help you improve your skills.<br>

If you are a former athlete, officiating will help you keep in touch with our great sport.<br>

At most meets, the organizers will give you lunch or at least a snack. Most will provide parking; 

and you can deduct transportation and other costs on your taxes.<br>

At quite a few meets, the organizers will give you a shirt or hat.<br>

Mostly, you’ll get the thanks of athletes, coaches, parents, and spectators--and other

officials--who know this sport cannot go forward without skilled, dedicated and

enthusiastic volunteers.
