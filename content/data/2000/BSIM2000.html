<BIG><B>Vanegas and Solominskaia Grab Big Sur International Marathon Titles</B></BIG>
<I>By Mark Winitz, Running USA wire</I>

CARMEL, Calif.--(April 30, 2000)--The landscape of the Big Sur coastline, 
where mountainous land meets deep blue ocean in a rocky and majestic 
transition, is awesomely beautiful. And the terrain is so rugged and 
challenging that early Spanish explorers initially gave it up as 
unnegotiable 
and uninhabitable. Neither Ecuador's Esterban Vanegas nor Russia's 
Natalia 
Solominskaia let the hilly 26.2-mile course from Big Sur to Carmel deter 
them. The pair won overall titles on a picture-perfect California 
morning, 
topping the field of about 2,660 marathon starters.

Vanegas, 29, who lives with his American wife in Alma, Michigan, overcame 
two 
opponents with better running credentials to record a convincing win in 2 
hours, 27 minutes, and 6 seconds. Russian Sergey Nochevny and pre-race 
favorite John Kipkoskei, a Kenyan 2:09 marathoner, accompanied Vanegas in 
a 
three-man front pack that stuck together for much of the race. At 
halfway, 
after negotiating the two-mile, 500-foot climb over Hurricane Point and 
back 
down, they were still together. And over the roller coaster hills that 
followed, they worked and waited together. When the tide turned, a 
bothersome 
pain developed in Nochevny's side and Kipkoskei's hamstring tightened up. 
That's when Vanegas struck at about 20 miles.

"I was feeling very good and I was strong each time the other guys 
pushed," 
Vanegas said. "At 20 miles I took advantage of a good downhill to push 
ahead. 
When they did not respond, my experience in the marathon told me that I 
was 
strongest today and that they probably would not come back. I am happy. 
My 
best marathon is 2:24, so on this course my effort was very good."

Nochevny, who ran a personal best of 2:16:01 at last year's Moscow 
Marathon, 
placed second, almost six minutes behind the winner. "Initially Kipkoskei 
went with Vanegas, but then I passed him at about 40 kilometers, and he 
wasn't quite walking," Nochevny commented. "I could tell he had some 
problem." Kipkoskei held on for third place.

Solominskaia, 38, who lives and trains in the deep forests of Siberia 
near 
the Mongolian border, is (like Vanegas) not well known in the U.S. In 
Europe, 
however, she won half marathon and marathon races last year, and was the 
1995 
Russian national marathon champion. Solominskaia's 2:46:53 women's win 
here 
was well-earned. She overcame a challenge from fellow Russian Elvira 
Kolpakova, the 27-year-old '99 European 100-kilometer champion who also 
holds 
a 2:34 marathon best. Speaking through an interpreter, Solominskaia said 
she 
pulled away from Kolpakova and spread a gap about four miles from the 
finish 
line.

Although Solominskaia remarked that her biggest challenge was the wind, 
according to many runners the headwinds that often greet them on this 
coastal 
course were largely absent this year. Kolpakova placed second in 2:49:53. 
Kari Distefano, 41, of Telluride, CO was third (2:55:02) and also earned 
laurels as first female master. Jean-Marc Seguy (residence not listed) 
was 
first master man in 2:44:23.

Neither the remarkable men's course record (2:16:39, 1987) held by 
six-time 
men's winner Brad Hawthorne, nor the women's standard (2:41:34, 1996) set 
by 
Svetlana Vasiyeva were in jeopardy.

In the accompanying NewsChannel 46 5K race, which served as a road race 
championship for the Pacific Association of USA Track &amp; Field, Ben 
Turman, 
30, of Kensington, CA and Katy Spink, 25, of Palo Alto, CA were crowned 
champions. Turman's winning time of 15:08 and Spink's of 17:35 were also 
registered on a hilly but scenic course.

The Big Sur International Marathon is rated the number one marathon in 
North 
America by "The Ultimate Guide to Marathons". Its excellent race 
organization, spectacular scenery, entertainment and hospitality is 
respected 
worldwide. In addition to the marathon and 5K, Big Sur offers a marathon 
relay and power walks at two distances, attracting a total of about 
10,000 
participants. The 3,700 openings for this year's marathon race sold out
