<BIG>Kemei and Szabo Win Inaugural Millennathon 2000 Road Race</BIG>

Oakland, CA - Taking advantage of mild conditions and a flat, fast half 
marathon course, Kenya's Philip Kemei, 22, and Karolina Szabo, 38,  of 
Hungary topped an enthusiastic field of about 1,300 runners at the 
inaugural Millennathon 2000 road race today. Kemei, won his U.S. road 
racing debut in 1 hour two minutes and 52 seconds. Szabo topped the women 
in 1:14:15. The road race, designed to celebrate the coming of the new 
millennium and the maturing of long distance running as a sport for 
everyone, included an accompanying 8K run/walk and races for kids.

Szabo,  a two-time Olympian, plus a large contingent of top U.S. women, 
used Millennathon as a major tune-up race for bids to represent their 
respective countries at this year's Olympic Games in Sydney, Australia. 
American females are focusing their sights on the U.S. Women's Olympic 
Marathon Trials that will take place in Columbia, South Carolina in just 
six weeks. Colorado's Libbie Hickman, who finished six seconds behind 
Szabo to capture second place, led this large group of U.S. Olympic 
aspirants. Oregon's Liz Wilson (1:14:23) and Rosa Gutierrez (1:14:37) of 
San Jose, CA finished third and fourth respectively.

Szabo, however, was the surprise of the field after spending several 
years out of the spotlight. She overtook early leaders Christine 
Junkermann and Chris McNamara by four miles and never looked back.

"I felt very good today, and thought the pace at that point was a little 
too slow for me," Szabo said, "so I decided to increase the pace a bit. 
I've gone through a couple of years of injuries, so this win was 
especially significant. It means I'm on  the right road again towards 
making my third Olympic team."

Hickman, 34, a leading contender to make the U.S. Olympic marathon team, 
was also pleased.

"I'm ecstatic," said Hickman, who ran the fastest marathon time (2:28:34) 
among U.S. women last year. "I'm happy because I really haven't started 
any speed work yet. This was a perfect opportunity six weeks before the 
trials. That's why I think so many top American women were here."

Californian Maria Trujillo de Rios (1:16:20) edged Kim Jones and Jane 
Welzel among master (40 years old and over) women. All three are also 
tuning for the marathon trials.

In the men's race, '96 Olympian Charles Mulinga of Zambia led for about 
10 kilometers. Kemei joined him for the next 5 kilometers before forging 
a 22 second gap over runner-up Mulinga by the finish line. Kenyan Patrick 
Kiptum was third, followed by first American Eddy Hellebuyck.

Millennathon 2000, which attracted about 1,300 participants, awarded a 
$26,200 half marathon prize purse. In addition, the race served as the 
half marathon championship for the Pacific Association of USA Track and 
Field. (Top results follow.)
